1600,"A LONG WAY FROM S  XXXIV. — THE BAR S  XXXV. — THE PERFECT I  XXXVI. — AN ALLY, AND SOLID G [SNIPPET] He wished nothing on his conscience.  Armed with the keys and the legal title, I took possession. In the daylight it was much as it had been the night before. Once across its threshold, one was in dank and furtive suppression; the air was heavy; a mould of age had streaked the walls and gloomed the shadows. I put up all the curtains to let in the rush of sunlight, likewise I opened the windows."
1601,"Argo walked to a brazier and deposited the flaming paper. Then she turned again to Geo. "" I can fog the brain of a single person, as I did with Snake; or I can bewilder a hundred men. As easily as I can fire a dried, worn map, I can raze a city."" ""With those to help,"" smiled Geo, ""I think we have a fair chance to reach this Hama, and return."" But the smile with which she answered his was strange, and then suddenly it was completely gone. "" Do you think,"" she said, ""that I would put such temptation in your hands? You might be captured, and if so, then the jewels would be in the hands of Aptor once more."" [SNIPPET] Snake, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. But I do want you to tell me. Very much."" Urson let the boy up, still mumbling, ""Well, he's not going to get away again."" ""When did he get away from you the first time?"" Geo said, coming over to the boy. "" Let him go."
1602,"""These are good days,"" said Morano. He forgot how short a time ago he had said regretfully that these days were not as the old days. But our race, speaking generally, is rarely satisfied with the present, and Morano's cheerfulness had not come from his having risen suddenly superior to this everyday trouble of ours; it came from his having shifted his gaze to the future. Two things are highly tolerable to us, and even alluring, the past and the future. It was only with the present that Morano was ever dissatisfied. [SNIPPET] said one.  ""It has many names,"" said Rodriguez.  And then another one of them recognised it from the shape of its roofs. "" It is Saint Judas-not-Iscariot,"" he said.  ""Aye, so strangers call it,"" said Rodriguez.  And where the road turned round that fold of the plain, lolling a little to its left in the idle Spanish air, they came upon the village all in view. I do not know how to describe this village to you, my reader, for the words that mean to you what it was are all the wrong words to use. "" Antique,"" ""old-world,"" ""quaint,"" seem words with which to tell of it. Yet it had no antiquity denied to the other villages; it had been brought to birth like them by the passing of time, and was nursed like them in the lap of plains or valleys of Spain."
1603,"I'm almost pleased to find it this primitive. I don't think it can have gone further anywhere on the planet, or we'd have seen cities, farms, roads, in the photographs. Unless——"" ""Unless what, Doctor?"" ""Oh—unless there might be forms with no Earth parallel. In the forests perhaps—even underground. Thought of that? But that's speculations, and our little soldiers here are fact. [SNIPPET] Dorothy stooped to demonstrate the mechanism a few times. "" I'm Dorothy, by the way, more widely known as the Dope, which is a title of uncommon distinction among my people, achieved only after long study of the art of saying the right thing at the wrong time, burning the bacon, and preserving at all times an air of sweet and addled dignity—Dorothy...."" She indicated herself plainly and pointed, with questioning eyebrows. The tree-frog voice, with no sternness, but a hint of friendliness: ""Tor-o-thee...?"" She imitated Dorothy's motions. "" Abro Pakriaa—"" ""Pakriaa."" ""Abro Pakriaa."""
1604,"In the cheaper schools, what is gained by the longer existence of the Specimen is lost, partly in the expenditure for food, and partly in the diminished accuracy of the angles, which are impaired after a few weeks of constant ""feeling"". Nor must we forget to add, in enumerating the advantages of the more expensive system, that it tends, though slightly yet perceptibly, to the diminution of the redundant Isosceles population—an object which every statesman in Flatland constantly keeps in view. On the whole therefore—although I am not ignorant that, in many popularly elected School Boards, there is a reaction in favour of ""the cheap system"" as it is called—I am myself disposed to think that this is one of the many cases in which expense is the truest economy.  But I must not allow questions of School Board politics to divert me from my subject. [SNIPPET] What was our horror when we saw before us a Figure! At the first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways; but a moment's observation shewed me that the extremities passed into dimness too rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should have thought it a Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a manner impossible for a Circle or for any regular Figure of which I had had experience.  But my Wife had not my experience, nor the coolness necessary to note these characteristics. With the usual hastiness and unreasoning jealousy of her Sex, she flew at once to the conclusion that a Woman had entered the house through some small aperture. "" How comes this person here?"" she exclaimed, ""you promised me, my dear, that there should be no ventilators in our new house."" "" Nor are there any,"" said I; ""but what makes you think that the stranger is a Woman? I see by my power of Sight Recognition——"" ""Oh, I have no patience with your Sight Recognition,"" replied she, ""'Feeling is believing' and 'A Straight Line to the touch is worth a Circle to the sight'""—two Proverbs, very common with the Frailer Sex in Flatland."
1605,"""A recipe from the curiosa section of my medical book,"" he said. "" I whipped up some capsules for my pocket kit, just in case of emergency, and I couldn't help thinking of them when—"" ""Never mind the buildup,"" Captain Corelli said. "" What was it?"" ""A formula invented by ancient Terran bartenders, and not recommended except in extreme cases,"" the Quack said. "" With a very odd name. It's called a twin Mickey."" We'd probably have murdered him then and there if the Quack's concoction had let us. [SNIPPET] Captain Corelli drew himself up stiffly. "" I think,"" he said, ""that the three of us should be able to unravel your little riddle, if you'll condescend to tell us what it is."" Gaffa sent a puzzled look at the Quack, and I could see that he was wondering why Corelli hadn't included him in the boast. But Gaffa didn't know how simple the Quack could be, nor how preoccupied with his own physiology he was. ""One of these two,"" said Gaffa, pointing to the two Haslops, ""is the original Ira Haslop, who was stranded here twenty-two Terran years ago. The other is a synthetic creation of ours—an android, if you like, who is identical, cell by cell, with the original so far as exterior likeness is concerned. We could not duplicate the interior without dissection, which of course was out of the question, so we were forced to make compromises that—"" Gibbons interrupted him incredulously. "" You mean you've created a living creature, brain and all?"""
1606,"""May I not take you to the car?"" ""You had better not."" At the door she turned back once more. "" Write me every day, or call me up on the telephone."" He straightened himself, as if to convince her of his strength. Yet when at last the door had closed behind her, his courage forsook him for a moment. [SNIPPET] Take your body along, but leave your brain behind—[Pg 68]at least do not take more of it with you than is necessary. The summer season in Atlantic City has just begun. There, as everywhere in American society, you will be much more welcome if you come without brains."" Reginald's half-bantering tone reassured Ernest a little. Timidly he dared approach once more the strange event that had wrought such havoc with his nervous equilibrium."
1607,"A few hundred miles outside the ship, the Lady May thought back at him, ""O warm, O generous, O gigantic man! O brave, O friendly, O tender and huge Partner! O wonderful with you, with you so good, good, good, warm, warm, now to fight, now to go, good with you...."" He knew that she was not thinking words, that his mind took the clear amiable babble of her cat intellect and translated it into images which his own thinking could record and understand. Neither one of them was absorbed in the game of mutual greetings. [SNIPPET] The odds suddenly moved down from a hundred to one against mankind to sixty to forty in mankind's favor. This was not enough. The telepaths were trained to become ultrasensitive, trained to become aware of the Dragons in less than a millisecond. But it was found that the Dragons could move a million miles in just under two milliseconds and that this was not enough for the human mind to activate the light beams. Attempts had been made to sheath the ships in light at all times."

1609,"Annales de Chimie, tom, xxviii. p. 190. Ibid. pp. [SNIPPET] These might, as to the matter, very properly have appeared in this volume, but they would have interfered with it as a simple reprint of the ""Experimental Researches"" of the Philosophical Transactions. Then I wish to refer, in relation to the Fourth Series on a new law of Electric Conduction, to Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice, which have been very properly separated and set forth by Professor Bache (Journal of the Franklin Institute, 1836. xvii. 183.). These, which I did not at all remember as to the extent of the effect, though they in no way anticipate the expression of the law I state as to the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes, still should never be forgotten when speaking of that law as applicable to the case of water."
1610,"You were like a baby, slobbering and whimpering in your sleep. The days were worse. You were drunk and shouting and weeping. To you blindness was the end."" [SNIPPET] The fat smile was empty, almost apologetic. "" We have younger, more handsome models...."" ""Well enough."" Duggan started donning the clothing that he had removed. "" I'll want the mech for five, possibly ten, hours."" ""I'll make out the slip for ten hours, sir. We'll refund any balance due you. But after ten hours ..."""
1611,“You—you’d better not—er—tell your mother or sister about your finger. I—I wouldn’t like your sister to be upset any more.” “Don’t you want me to let ’em know?” “Er—no.” [SNIPPET] They’re jus’ a few sweets Aunt Susan kin’ly gave me an’——” “Be quiet! Where are they?” Slowly and reluctantly William drew forth his bag. His father seized it and flung it far into the bushes. For the next ten minutes William conducted a thorough and systematic search among[19] the bushes and for the rest of the day consumed Gooseberry Eyes and garden soil in fairly equal proportions.
1612,"It was Neinfort-Whritings's lisping voice. ""Whatever it is, this sort of nonsense must be stopped at the beginning. It might set a precedent."" ""May I suggest,"" Rovance broke in, ""that, as the matter of precedent is sure to arise, we take no action without first consulting Lesquallan Ltd."" ""An excellent idea,"" Esrov nodded. He switched on the intercom to his first secretary. "" [SNIPPET] ""And,"" Swenson added, ""be damned sure that speech insert will run at least ten minutes. More, if possible."" Mister Cerobie slammed the door. Five minutes later, slim, soft-spoken Van Euing, Acme's attorney, coughed behind the dispatcher's chair. Swenson swiveled from coding the astrogram and dropped his cigarette. "" What the hell—oh, you. Lawyers are like policemen—they sneak up on people."" ""How did you know I was the firm's attorney?"" ""I watched you try that unfair-trade-practice suit against Lesquallan Ltd. two years ago."
1613,"Chaucer uses “palmer” of all pilgrims.  3. “ Hallows” survives, in the meaning here given, in All Hallows — All-Saints — day. “ Couth,” past participle of “conne” to know, exists in “uncouth.”  4. The Tabard — the sign of the inn — was a sleeveless coat, worn by heralds. The name of the inn was, some three centuries after Chaucer, changed to the Talbot. [SNIPPET] She thought, “I will with other maidens stand, That be my fellows, in our door, and see The marchioness; and therefore will I fand* *strive To do at home, as soon as it may be, The labour which belongeth unto me, And then I may at leisure her behold, If she this way unto the castle hold.”  And as she would over the threshold gon, The marquis came and gan for her to call, And she set down her water-pot anon Beside the threshold, in an ox’s stall, And down upon her knees she gan to fall, And with sad* countenance kneeled still, *steady Till she had heard what was the lorde’s will.

And she with reverence, *in humble cheer,* *with humble air* Answered, “Lord, he is all ready here.”"
1614,"“One wouldn’t think so,” agreed Darquelnoy. “ In a way,” he added, “that spaceship was a hopeful sign. It means that they’ll be sending a manned ship along pretty soon, and that should do the trick. As soon as one side has a base on the Moon, the other side is bound to get things started.” “A relief for you, eh?” said Ebor. “You know,” said Darquelnoy thoughtfully, “I can’t help thinking I was born in the wrong age. [SNIPPET] As soon as one side has a base on the Moon, the other side is bound to get things started.” “A relief for you, eh?” said Ebor. “You know,” said Darquelnoy thoughtfully, “I can’t help thinking I was born in the wrong age. All this scrabbling around, searching everywhere for suitable planets. Back when the Universe was younger, there were lots and lots of planets to colonize."
1615,"And so we swept on through space, with Rigel a great blue glory ahead, and new stars, invisible at greater distances, flaring up in front of us and then fading into the background as we passed. For a long time we had been able to see that Rigel, as inferred from spectroscopic evidence, was a double star—a fainter, greener blue companion revolving with it around their common center of gravity. Beyond Kappa Orionis, three hundred light-years from the sun, the space between the two was quite evident. Beyond four hundred light-years, the brilliance of the vast star was so great that it dimmed all the other stars by comparison, and made the nebula seem a mere faint gauze. And yet even with this gradual change, our arrival was a surprise. When he relieved me at my watch, Garth seemed dissatisfied with our progress. "" It must be farther than they've figured. I'll stick at twenty-five times light speed, and slow down after we get there by taking an orbit."" [SNIPPET] That's it."" Involuntarily, I gasped. "" Then—how far away are we?"" ""I put on full acceleration fifteen hours ago, when we passed Neptune, and we have covered thirty billion miles—three hundred times as far as from the moon to the sun, but only one half of one per cent of a light-year."" I was speechless, and Garth led me back to the control board. He pointed out the acceleration control, now turned up to its last notch forward; he also showed me the dials which were used to change our direction."
1616,"SECOND ATTENDANT.—This lioness will certainly attack you if you do not release her whelp. CHILD [laughing].—Oh! indeed! let her come. Much I fear her, to be sure. [ Pouts his under-lip in defiance.   KING.—The germ of mighty courage lies c [SNIPPET] The courtiers resolved accordingly to prevail on the Lion to kill the Camel; 'for what interest have we,' they said, 'in this browser of thistles?' 'What, indeed!' observed the Tiger; 'but will the Rajah kill him after his promise of protection, think you?' 'Being famished he will,' said the Crow. ' Know you not?— Accordingly they repaired to the Lion."
1617,"""I quite agree,"" replied Arcot. The ship turned about, and dived toward New York, a hundred thousand miles behind now, at a speed many times that of light as Arcot snapped into time. Across the void, Zezdon Fentes' call had come—New York was to be attacked by the Thessians, New York and Chicago next. New York because the orbits of their two forts were converging over that city in a few minutes! They were in the atmosphere, screaming through it as their relux glowed instantaneously in the Heaviside layer, then was through before damage could be done. The screen was up. [SNIPPET] Arcot's manner became serious now. "" We haven't gotten our Government Expense Research Cards yet, and you have. Order the stuff, and get it out here, while we get ready for it. Honestly, I believe that a few ships such as this apparatus will permit, will be enough in themselves to do the job. It really is a pity that the other men didn't have the opportunity we had for crowding much work into little time! ""But then, I wouldn't want to take that road to concentration again myself! ""Have the enemy amused you in my absence? Come on, let's sit down in the house instead of standing here in the sun."""
1618,"Those who have tasted sersee add fifty of our years to their lives."" Carver opened his eyes wide. Fifty years on Loray was roughly the equivalent of sixty-three on Earth. The sersee was more than a healing agent, more than a regenerator. It was a longevity drug as well. [SNIPPET] Last month he had photographed a srag, from a vantage point very high in a very tall, stout tree. He knew it for a large, ill-tempered, quick-moving beast, with a dismaying array of claws, teeth and horns. It was also the only non-taboo meat-bearing animal on the planet. The natives had to kill srags or starve. But the wounded man had not been quick enough with spear and shield, and the srag had opened him from throat to pelvis."
1619,"For on land or air there is always something excessive and hindering; as arms that swing at the sides of a man, and which the mind must remember. The stag has legs to be tucked away for sleep, and untucked for movement; and the bird has wings that must be folded and pecked and cared for. But the fish has but one piece from his nose to his tail. He is complete, single and unencumbered. He turns in one turn, and goes up and down and round in one sole movement.  “How I flew through the soft element: how I joyed in the country where there is no harshness: in the element which upholds and gives way; which caresses and lets go, and will not let you fall. For man may stumble in a furrow; the stag tumble from a cliff; the hawk, wing-weary and beaten, with darkness around him and the storm behind, may dash his brains against a tree. But the home of the salmon is his delight, and the sea guards all her creatures.” [SNIPPET] “I can help,” Fiacuil replied, “but I must be paid.”  “What payment?”  “A third of all you earn and a seat at your council.”  “I grant that,” said Fionn, “and now, tell me your plan?”  “You remember my spear with the thirty rivets of Arabian gold in its socket?”  “The one,” Fionn queried, “that had its head wrapped in a blanket and was stuck in a bucket of water and was chained to a wall as well—the venomous Birgha?” “ That one,” Fiacuil replied."
1620,"""But in that case the Board of Appeals said they allowed such terminology only because the equivalency of the substances could be foreseen by those skilled in the art, foreseen with certainty, too. Can you say that about your substances?"" I hesitated before I answered, and that was all he needed to take over. "" A large number of ingredients was recited in In re Ellis, and since there was no evidence to show that they all would not work, the applicant was allowed broad claims. But you'd have trouble making your guessed-at ingredients stick. In the case of Corona Cord Tire Company v. Dovan, the court said the patentee was entitled to his broader claims because he proved he had tested a reasonable number of the members of a chemical class. [SNIPPET] We all laughed as I took half a dozen twelve-by-twelve hand sheets out of my briefcase and passed them around the table. I watched the chemists finger the sheets, savoring their soft coolness, and I heard the whispered comments, ""good hand,"" ""excellent softness,"" ""fine color,"" and a few others. Dr. Rude said, ""Are these 'breaking samples', Mr. Saddle? Do you mind if we tear them?"" Well, you can see that this was the question I was waiting for. I sat back and allowed a slight smile to play over my face. I said, ""Oh no, gentlemen."
1621,"Probably on automatic record only, at this time of night. Still, we don't want to leave any records for them to study after we're gone."" ""Were you ever here before?"" I asked. ""No,"" he replied, ""but I haven't been studying their electrophone communications for seven years without being able to recognize these machines when I run across them."" So far we had not laid eyes on a Han. The tower seemed deserted. Blash and Gaunt, however, assured me that there would be at least one man on ""duty"" in the military offices, though he would probably be asleep, and two or three in the library proper and the projectoscope plant. ""We've got to put them out of commission,"" I said. "" [SNIPPET] You hit it! Do it again; bring it down!"" We had only one more rocket of extreme range between us, and we dropped it three times in our excitement in inserting it in my gun. Then, forcing myself to be calm by sheer will power, while Wilma stuffed her little fist into her mouth to keep from shrieking, I sighted carefully again and fired. In a flash, Wilma had grasped the hope that this discovery of mine might lead to the end of the Han domination. The elapsed time of the rocket's invisible flight seemed an age. Then we saw the ship falling."
1622,"As a matter of fact, sir, I have compiled a manuscript collection of religious quotations, hymns, sermons and uplifting thoughts which now fill fourteen volumes, all in my own handwriting. Fortunately, I inherited money, and this collection is my gift to the world."" ""And a noble one, I'm sure,"" I said. ""Most noble,"" said Mr. Solander. "" But, sir, I have not confined my activities to the study chair. I have kept my eye on the progress of the world. [SNIPPET] But, sir, it is being twisted to cheap uses. Jazz! Cheap songs! Worldly words and music! That I mean to remedy."" ""Well,"" I said, ""it might be done."
1623,"The game went on. And a few minutes later, in the shower room, where Jack Kinnison was caroling lustily while plying a towel, a huge young man strode up and slapped him ringingly between the shoulder blades. ""Congratulations, Jack, and so forth. But there's a thing I want to ask you. [SNIPPET] ""I know they do. We have known all along that he is a masterly actor; we now know that he is more than that."" ""Yes, and we're finding out that no appeal to reason, no psychological counter-measures, will work. Dronvire and I agree that you'll have to arrange matters so that you can do solid months of stumping yourself. Personally."" ""It may come to that, but there's a lot of other things to do first."""
1624,"Surely we don't need to be ceremonious."" Thurmon pricked up his ears at the sound of the unfamiliar word. He wasn't the scholarly type, like Littlejohn. But he appreciated Littlejohn's learning and knew he was important to the council. They needed scholars these days, and antiquarians too. One has to look to the past when rebuilding a world. ""You sent for me?"" Littlejohn asked. The question was purely rhetorical, but he wanted to break the silence. [SNIPPET] How many of them end up in a place like this?"" ""They don't, though. That's just Naturalist propaganda. Dr. Manschoff said—"" ""Dr. Manschoff said! I know what he said, all right. And you believed him, because you wanted to believe him. You wanted the reassurance he could offer you—the feeling of being unique and important."
1625,"And wait until we show this creep to Professor Zalpha and Exmud R. Zmorro."" We come to the surface and contact an Earthian Franco-Austro atomic luxury liner. The skipper's pan registers on the viso-screen. "" This is Septimus Spink,"" I says. "" Commander of Inner Spaceship Magnificent Mole. I have come from the center of Earth with a captured Subterro submarine and Agrodyte Hitler, the Neofeuhrer. Over and out."" [SNIPPET] He just qualifies as a spaceman as he takes up very little and is not much easier to look at than a Nougatine. Once D'Ambrosia applied for a plasticectomy but the surgeons at the Muzayo clinic just laughed and told him there was a limit to science even in the year 2022. But the citizen was at home when they divided the brains. Of course that is only my opinion."
1626,"It was painted scarlet. Her eyes were hard and dark. But her body, as if to atone for her face, was made in a series of soft curves that fitted exquisitely into her black silk dress. He tortured himself looking at her. She permitted it sullenly. "" [SNIPPET] ""Bravo! We shall revenge ourselves."" The man gulped a glass of wine, slapped Hugo's shoulder, and was gone. Then a girl talked to Hugo."
1627,"of England, Edward II., Henry VI., Richard III., Mary Stuart, Charles I., the three Henrys of France, the Emperor Henry IV.! You know——"" [SNIPPET] He put back, overwhelmed with sorrow, for indeed he had lost sufficient to make the fortune of twenty monarchs. He waited upon the Dutch magistrate, and in his distress he knocked over loudly at the door. He entered and told his adventure, raising his voice with unnecessary vehemence. The magistrate began by fining him ten thousand piastres for making a noise; then he listened patiently, promised to examine into his affair at the skipper's return, and ordered[Pg 95] him to pay ten thousand piastres for the expense of the hearing. This drove Candide to despair; he had, indeed, endured misfortunes a thousand times worse; the coolness of the magistrate and of the skipper who had robbed him, roused his choler and flung him into a deep melancholy. The villainy of mankind presented itself before his imagination in all its deformity, and his mind was filled with gloomy ideas."
1628,"Another of the globes had been attached to the mailbox, and the legs had been burned loose from the concrete sidewalk. Confidently, Whedbee lifted the light object, carried it to the truck, and deposited it inside. ""Bleachers there,"" said Chief Grindstaff. ""What you say, chief?"" ""Stands there. No, stand there."" [SNIPPET] The minds of the others were in constant confusion. They believed, actually, in nothing. Somehow, he saw me, Eo. I was forced to kill him."" ""No harm done,"" Eo decided. He faced the machines and said, ""Destroy the vehicle, draw in the camouflage net, prepare for take-off."" The machines rolled from the compartment, and the two creatures followed."
1629,"As for your escaping from this valley—you cannot. The fog will bring you back."" ""I've got my compass."" I glanced at it, saw that the needle was spinning at random. Lhar said: ""The Other has many powers. Whenever you go into the fog, you will always return here."" ""How do you know all this?"" I asked. [SNIPPET] The rope jerked out of my hand and the animal cried out almost articulately as it went over. I stood frozen, pressing against the stone, listening to the sound of the burro's fall. Finally the distant noise died in a faint trickling of snow and gravel that faded into utter silence. So thick was the fog that I had seen nothing."
1630,"After a few moments, Honath heard a low whistle. Creeping sidewise toward the source of the sound, he nearly bumped into Alaskon, who was crouched beneath a thickly-spreading magnolia. An instant later, Mathilda's face peered out of the dim greenery. ""Look,"" Alaskon whispered. "" What do you make of this?"" [SNIPPET] Above, the Parrot's starry plumes flickered and faded into the general blue. Toward the center of the saucer above the grove, the stitched leaf-and-leather houses clustered thickly, bound to the vines themselves, or hanging from an occasional branch too high or too slender to bear the vines. Many of these purses Honath knew well, not only as visitor but as artisan. The finest of them, the inverted flowers which opened automatically as the morning dew bathed them, yet which could be closed tightly and safely around their occupants at dusk by a single draw-string, were his own design as well as his own handiwork."
1631,"""In a few minutes,"" he told me, ""I'll have the answer to a question that may never have been answered before: what is reality? Is the world a thing by itself, and all we know illusion? Why do things grow smaller the farther away from us they appear? Why can't we see more than one side of anything at a time? What happens to the far side of an object; does it cease to exist just because we can't see it? Are objects not present nonexistent? Because artists draw things vanishing to points, does that mean that they really vanish?"" A wack, that's what he was. [SNIPPET] He kept saying more goofy things while he was finishing up the machine, about how he'd figured out that all we knew about vision and drawing and so on must be wrong, and that once he got a look at the real world he'd prove it. ""How about cameras?"" I asked him. "" Take a picture with a camera and it looks just about the same as a drawing, don't it?"" ""That's because cameras are built to take pictures like we're used to seeing them,"" he said. """
1632,"""The only known keys, that is."" ""Oh? How's that, General?"" ""The sergeant can open the brief case and use the item if we tell him how."" ""You think it's time to use it? [SNIPPET] Me, for instance."" ""No?"" she said. "" Judging by that satchel you're handcuffed to, I'd have thought you were a courier for the Pentagon. Or maybe State."" He laughed quickly and loudly because she was getting uncomfortably close. "" Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous. I'm a messenger for the Riggs National Bank, that's all."
1633,"The Labyrinth is supposed to be inside the ear; it leads inside in a roundabout way; it's the same here, it's a tunnel—see—down we go."" The soft swoosh of the gas-turbine turned into a muffled roar. The car accelerated at a terrific rate and from the way it swayed and dived it was clear that the tunnel spiralled downwards in steep serpentines. Lee gripped the holding straps; his every nerve was on edge and those edges were sharpened by the ominous fact that all the instruments on the dashboard had stopped functioning so that he couldn't even read the speed. As if to make things still worse, the chauffeur had abandoned his post altogether. [SNIPPET] The flight engineer glanced at the irritated scientist curiously and sympathetically: ""If you don't know, I couldn't tell you what it's all about myself, I'm sure,"" he said slowly. "" Cephalon—Cephalon is a place alright, but it doesn't show on the map. Sort of a Shangri-la, if you know what I mean."" This cryptic statement failed to have a calming effect on Lee. """
1634,"As she did so her fingers touched the metal. A bright flash came from the silver disk, raced up her arm, and her muscles tightened in shock. Her voice rose suddenly in a scream, and then, as Jensen jerked violently under her hands, everything went black. She slumped beside him, unconscious, and the hum from the loudspeaker took on a higher, treble note that filled the whole laboratory with its vibrant pulsations. High over the valley came a keening note, drifting down the wind with a strange, heterodyning effect. It rose and fell with a definite cadence, as though it were a message. Out of the murky darkness at the far end came a stirring; a gigantic groping, as of a monstrous something responding sluggishly to the call. Then, more swiftly, getting its bearings, the shadowed something began moving forward, gaining purpose, gaining massiveness, gaining speed. There was almost an anxious eagerness in its progress, as though it were an appetite sensing a free meal. [SNIPPET] Oh Dahnjen, what shall we do?"" She flung her arms around his neck and clung to him. "" Is this the way our love will end?"" He bent his head and kissed her, then he grinned at her. "" In just a moment you will learn more about that,"" he said. "" But right now, you crouch down behind me and stay there. As soon as I can see, you'll find out that not only the Priests are possessed of wonderful instruments."" He slipped the rifle from his shoulder and held it ready in his hands. The searching ray swept over them several times, and the third pass found them."
1635,"I got a big claim here."" ""I know that,"" I told him. "" Congratulations for it."" ""Thanks,"" he said, but he still looked peevish. "" You're here about Jafe's insurance, right?"" [SNIPPET] The way I understood it, Karpin was well-known back on Atronics City—it was the normal base of operations for he and his partner—and he didn't know a soul at Chemisant City. Did it make sense for him to go somewhere he wasn't known after his partner's death, even if it was an hour closer? No, it made a lot more sense for a man in that situation to go where he's known, go someplace where he has friends who'll sympathize with him and help him over the shock of losing a partner of fifteen years' standing, even if going there does mean traveling an hour longer. And there was always the cash-return form. That was what I was here about in the first place. It just didn't make sense for McCann to have held up his celebration while he filled out a form that he wouldn't be able to mail until he got back to Atronics City."
1636,"""Okay, Pat. We'll dismiss the details as trivial and get down to brass tacks. What is your invention used for?"" ""Eh?"" said the redhead. ""It's not enough that an idea is practicable,"" I pointed out. "" [SNIPPET] And four other starts this season. That's been our big trouble. He shows such promise that the judges have placed him under a terrific weight handicap. To run in next week's Gold Stakes, for instance, he would have to carry 124 pounds. I was hesitant to enter him because of that. But with Pat's new invention—"" She turned to Pat, eyes glowing—""he could enter and win!"" Pat said uncertainly, ""I don't know."
1637,"protested Dan. "" Are you and Leucon alone in this valley? Where—what happened to your parents—your father and mother?"" ""They went away. That way—toward the sunrise. They'll return some day."" ""And if they don't?"" ""Why, foolish one! [SNIPPET] she said in queer soft tones. "" I can speak a little English."" She spoke slowly, carefully. "" I learned it from""—she hesitated—""my mother's father, whom they call the Grey Weaver."""
1638,"The clock on the wall over the dispatcher's desk showed 2:59 when Swenson called Acme's Luna City Terminal. "" Dispatcher to Numbers 7 and 4, have crew stand by to blast off in exactly 15 minutes. I don't give a damn about regulations or the P.C.C. This is an order from your company. It must be obeyed. Number 7 will follow course as originally planned—destination Mars. [SNIPPET] ""On what grounds am I to base my order?"" ""Claim they started the fight and our crew's so bashed up that we haven't enough able men to blast off."" ""But I'm afraid we can't prove that."" ""And what's it going to cost us to try? You're on retainer. The total bill for said restraining order will be only the price of some legal paper and the services of a notary. The steno's hired by the month, like you."" Van Euing looked puzzled. "" What good will it do?"""
1639,"“Forget it. Sit tight there. I think I know how to slip in—alone.” He switched off. He stood up and shrugged his shoulders heavily, loosening his tensed muscles. Then he turned purposefully to Manning. “The rest of the party won’t be here for awhile yet, so you can’t possibly go in now. I’m going to try to get Mara out before any fighting starts.” “What if they capture you too?” [SNIPPET] THERE WAS … COMMUNICATION RAPPORT. TEBRON WAS KING PRIEST. “Then Tebron made this prohibition in the name of Kor. When did this occur?” THE KNOWLEDGE PROHIBITION WAS COMMUNICATED TO HIRLAJ WHEN TEBRON ASSUMED POWER RIGHT. “The same day?” THE DAY AFTER. TEBRON COMMUNICATED WITH KOR IMMEDIATELY AFTER OUSTING REPLACING THE PRIESTS."
1640,"The shape was there and could not be denied. It had somehow fitted back into its natural shape and it was a baby screamer—well, maybe not a baby, but at least a tiny screamer. Duncan sat back on his heels and sweated. He wiped his bloody hands upon the ground. He wondered what other shapes he'd find if he put back into proper place the other hunks of limpness that lay beside the fire. He tried and failed. They were too smashed and torn. [SNIPPET] In the end, for some obscure reason—obscure to humans, that is—Sipar's loyalty had been to the Cytha. But then what was the use of searching for any reason in it? Nothing that had happened made any sense. It made no sense that a beast one was pursuing should up and talk to one—although it did fit in with the theory of the crisis-beast he had fashioned in his mind."
1641,"The revelation was still too much with him. He watched as Arnold conferred with a group of his techs about a micro-chron, and the time was carefully noted for Central Record. Then the first of the tapes went in. The Basic Invariant—Amos Carmack. It reached synapse and a tiny blip registered on cue. The rest of the tapes fed in, razoring through the rollers, past the selenic-sensitized tips of the relays. [SNIPPET] At once means now."" Beardsley nodded approval. "" And now Professor Losch, please?"" Without a waste of motion, Mandleco put through to Bermuda on priority beam. While they waited he gave Beardsley a look of puzzlement and new respect. "" Ah—I'm not implying that it's against protocol, of course, but I assume you've already made some investigation along lines of your own?"""
1642,"The professor had figured out the amount of radium necessary to carry the rocket far enough away from the earth so that it would not turn around and crash, and still be not so far away but what the earth's gravitational attraction would keep it from leaving the vicinity of the earth and the solar system. Like the moon, it would forever revolve around the earth. He had chosen an orbit sixty-five thousand miles from the earth for his rocket to follow. The only fears he had entertained concerned the huge meteors which careened through space at tremendous rates of speed. He had overcome this obstacle, however, and had eliminated the possibilities of a collision with these stellar juggernauts. [SNIPPET] ""I'm trying to,"" replied the machine man, ""but it seems to jump away a bit every time I get within a certain distance of it. Our ship seems to jump backward a bit too."" ""Are they trying to elude us?"" ""I don't know. They should pick up more speed if that is their object."""
1643,"“But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your own experience—during your control of this house—have you had practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic?”  “Here?—in my own experience?—why, I may say, yes. For example:—no very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this very house. The ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in operation, and the patients were at large. They behaved remarkably well—especially so—any one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact, that the fellows behaved so remarkably well. And, sure enough, one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had usurped the offices of the keepers.”  “You don’t tell me so! I never heard of any thing so absurd in my life!”  “Fact—it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow—a lunatic—who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before—of lunatic government, I mean. [SNIPPET] The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely loss of his parents—forgetting, however, his atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period immediately succeeding that bereavement. Some there were, indeed, who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity. Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician) did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were current among the multitude.  Indeed, the Baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired charger—an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every fresh example of the animal’s ferocious and demon-like propensities—at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men, a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the glare of noon—at the dead hour of night—in sickness or in health—in calm or in tempest—the young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded with his own spirit.  There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. The space passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest expectations of the most imaginative. The Baron, besides, had no particular name for the animal, although all the rest in his collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. His stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the enclosure of that particular stall."
1644,"The price which is paid to them by the stone-cutter, is altogether the wages of their labour; neither rent nor profit makes an part of it.  But the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself into some one or other or all of those three parts; as whatever part of it remains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole labour employed in raising, manufacturing, and bringing it to market, must necessarily be profit to somebody.  As the price or exchangeable value of every particular commodity, taken separately, resolves itself into some one or other, or all of those three parts; so that of all the commodities which compose the whole annual produce of the labour of every country, taken complexly, must resolve itself into the same three parts, and be parcelled out among different inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of their stock, or the rent of their land. The whole of what is annually either collected or produced by the labour of every society, or, what comes to the same thing, the whole price of it, is in this manner originally distributed among some of its different members. Wages, profit, and rent, are the three original sources of all revenue, as well as of all exchangeable value. All other revenue is ultimately derived from some one or other of these.  Whoever derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, must draw it either from his labour, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue derived from labour is called wages; that derived from stock, by the person who manages or employs it, is called profit; that derived from it by the person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is called the interest or the use of money. It is the compensation which the borrower pays to the lender, for the profit which he has an opportunity of making by the use of the money. [SNIPPET] The more gold, besides, that is annually imported from some particular countries, over and above what is requisite for plate and for coin, the more must necessarily be exported to some others: and the more that most insignificant object of modern policy, the balance of trade, appears to be in our favour with some particular countries, the more it must necessarily appear to be against us with many others.  It was upon this silly notion, however, that England could not subsist without the Portugal trade, that, towards the end of the late war, France and Spain, without pretending either offence or provocation, required the king of Portugal to exclude all British ships from his ports, and, for the security of this exclusion, to receive into them French or Spanish garrisons. Had the king of Portugal submitted to those ignominious terms which his brother-in-law the king of Spain proposed to him, Britain would have been freed from a much greater inconveniency than the loss of the Portugal trade, the burden of supporting a very weak ally, so unprovided of every thing for his own defence, that the whole power of England, had it been directed to that single purpose, could scarce, perhaps, have defended him for another campaign. The loss of the Portugal trade would, no doubt, have occasioned a considerable embarrassment to the merchants at that time engaged in it, who might not, perhaps, have found out, for a year or two, any other equally advantageous method of employing their capitals; and in this would probably have consisted all the inconveniency which England could have suffered from this notable piece of commercial policy.  The great annual importation of gold and silver is neither for the purpose of plate nor of coin, but of foreign trade. A round-about foreign trade of consumption can be carried on more advantageously by means of these metals than of almost any other goods. As they are the universal instruments of commerce, they are more readily received in return for all commodities than any other goods; and, on account of their small bulk and great value, it costs less to transport them backward and forward from one place to another than almost any other sort of merchandize, and they lose less of their value by being so transported. Of all the commodities, therefore, which are bought in one foreign country, for no other purpose but to be sold or exchanged again for some other goods in another, there are none so convenient as gold and silver. In facilitating all the different round-about foreign trades of consumption which are carried on in Great Britain, consists the principal advantage of the Portugal trade; and though it is not a capital advantage, it is, no doubt, a considerable one."
1645,"He said—"" The old woman came closer and inspected Sira, who endured her gaze calmly. That look was like the bite of acid that reveals the structure of crystal in metals. ""Why, she's a lady!"" she exclaimed then. "" Not fittin' to be on the same canal with you! Come in, my dear. You must be nearly dead!"" She conducted Sira into the hut, which was far neater and cleaner than its exterior suggested.[55] [SNIPPET] ""No!"" Sira interrupted him coldly. "" No! No!"
1646,"Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back. ""This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"" said Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: ""My dearest Lizzy, ""I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. [SNIPPET] She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. ""Good gracious!"" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, ""if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."""
1647,"Commercial propaganda too. ""Why, the stuff we put out was a crime! The service to the teletabloids was the worst. You know how they outstrip the news; hired actors take the part of personages in the news. [SNIPPET] Go on!"" ""Curiously enough, these raids were so timed that they were witnessed by the news telecasters. All of the people on Earth were thus eye-witnesses, and feeling ran high. Am I right?"" ""Go on!""[8] ""And of course you know about the raids on the Martian borium mines by pirates armed with modern weapons. In the fights, some of the pirates' weapons were captured. They bore the ordnance marks of the terrestrial government."" ""I'm way ahead of you, girlie!"""
1648,"Featherbedding had been carefully specified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb Mars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization. They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people for the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to isolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet and his fellows. The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. [SNIPPET] She leaned forward and breathed a moist warmth into his ear, and worried the lobe with her even white teeth. ""Daniel Boone,"" she sighed huskily, ""only killed three Indians in his life."" ""I know."" Manet folded his arms stoically and added: ""Please don't talk."" She sighed her instant agreement and moved her expressive hands over his chest and up to the hollows of his throat."
1649,"I thought my wrath went all toward the first mate now. But black turned white in my head, into something that I could bite into, when he flung the whip to Cat and cried, 'Here, Big Sailor, you've done your ship one good turn. Now rub sleep off your face and do it another. I want ten stripes on that one's back deep enough to count easily with a finger dipped in salt.' ""They fell, and I didn't breathe the whole time. Ten lashes is a whipping a man can recover from in a week. [SNIPPET] Hey, Whitey,"" the black sailor said again, and then he stepped back, slowly. Mist enveloped the ship three hours out from port. Urson was called for duty right after breakfast, but no one bothered either Snake or Geo that first morning. Snake would slip off somewhere and Geo would be left to wander the ship alone. He was walking beneath the dories when the heavy slap of bare feet on the wet deck materialized in Urson. "" Hey,"" greeted his friend. """
1650,"""Come, get in the ship, accompany us to your capital."" The men turned, and retreated to their position behind the rocks, while Morey and Zezdon Afthen waited for them. Soon they returned, and entered the ship. ""Our world,"" explained the leader rapidly, ""is a single unified colony. The capital is 'Shesto,' our world we call 'Talso.'"" His directions were explicit, and Arcot started for Shesto, on Talso. [SNIPPET] Place these on your heads, for only a moment. I must induce temporary hypnotic coma. Let one try first if you desire."" The leader of the visitors held out one of the several headsets they had brought, caplike things, made of laminated metal apparently. Arcot hesitated, then with a grin slipped it on."
1651,"""G-go ahead and ask me,"" he said. "" It d-doesn't make any difference now."" Jordan sat down on the floor. "" The boy was the one who gave you away. If not for him, no one would have ever known what planet you were on. [SNIPPET] The agent gave it a passing glance and tossed it into a wire basket. Then he pushed his uniform cap back exposing a bald head. "" You're my last customer for a while, until the rocket from Sirius comes in. Guess I might as well relax for a minute."" He reached into a drawer of the desk and pulled out a package of cigarettes, of which he lit one."
1652,"""Excuse me,"" said the machinist suddenly, ""I just forgot—whether you take—cigars or cigarettes. You see I only acted as—table orderly—once—when Smith had that sprain."" His hands moved uncertainly on the shelves, beyond the map. The heart of Professor Hooker leaped. ""Cigars!"" he almost shouted. [SNIPPET] That would be, as you say here, 'lifting one's self by one's own boot-straps.' I do not doubt the accuracy of your clocks and scientific instruments. Those of my own country are in harmony with yours. But to say that the cause of all this is a man is preposterous. If the mysterious Pax makes the heavens fall, they will tumble on his own head."
1653,"""Remembered my pistol just in time,"" gasped the doctor from the floor. "" Don't bother about me. I'm all right. Stop Solinski, for God's sake."" Although his lungs seemed bursting Baron turned and flew up the stairs. Being familiar with every turn, he gained on the Russian and caught sight of the dreadful black coat-tails as his enemy burst through to the twentieth floor. The locked door of the apartment baffled him only a moment. Stepping back, Solinski hurled his giant frame against the panels. [SNIPPET] Seeing that the engineer still looked puzzled, June interposed: ""It's something like enchantment,"" she explained. "" The old legends are full of it—the Sleeping Beauty, Brunhilde, Rip Van Winkle. I am convinced that in ancient times a few persons knew how to draw a fairy ring about those they wished to injure or protect, placing them thus outside the reach of time and change. This has now happened the world over, perhaps through some drift in the ether or germ in the brain."
1654,"Otherwise, should you choose not to be bound by our laws, we must respectfully and finally bid you farewell. When at some future date, we develop ships such as yours, we may reconsider."" The speaker paused, looked at his three confreres, who nodded silently. The First stared arrogantly at Mazechazz, and continued.  ""Finally, we have decided to place a ban on further landings by aliens unless you are now prepared to negotiate a trade agreement on our terms!""    Powers thought frantically, his face motionless. [SNIPPET] Mazechazz gave no indication that he had heard. He tried again.  ""In addition to trade and education, general advancement of the populace,"" murmured the mike, ""have you considered defense?"" He paused. "" Not all races who travel in space are friendly. A few are starkly inimical, hating all other forms of life. Could you defend yourselves, Honorable Sirs, against such?""  It was obvious from the speed of the answer that the Council of Mureess had considered, if not anticipated this question. The second member spoke, an obvious pre-assignment."
1655,"Me. Good Lord, just because O'Reilly's English wasn't perfect! What did I expect for only three weeks? Hummm. The atomic structure of the entire ship must be uniformly charged to ... Damn! High dragon bump!"" ""I don't getcha,"" Sheilah said. "" What's with this high dragon bump business? [SNIPPET] the Cirissin rumbled. Wayne said, ""Yes. Do you mind telling me what you want a high dragon bump for?"" ""Blast away hearth,"" the Cirissin replied unhesitatingly. Wayne swallowed and found it unnaturally difficult to do so. ""To blast away earth?"""
1656,"Henry took the plane. He put up at his club, went to the bar, and was gobbling down something called pressurized scotch, when he heard a noise back of him. ""Get away from me!"" said Henry, who was quite a few over the traditional eight by this time. "" I've had enough of Don Manton, let alone his helpers."" [SNIPPET] I've had enough of Don Manton, let alone his helpers."" Speed Roggs, who had taken a couple of trips with Manton, was tall and thin as the barstool, and with a spaceman's ability to think fast when he had to. Loudly he ordered a Venuswiz, explaining to a disgusted Henry, ""After the barkeep mixes the drink he melts the swizzle stick and pours that in, too."" He gulped the stuff down gratefully, then said, ""Tell me your troubles, Hank."" Henry did. Speed Roggs looked disgusted. "" Are you serious?"""
1657,"The wind whistled in its wings. Away to the left, the cliff fell back in a wide crescent, and nearly opposite him a river tumbled over the edge. A pool on a ledge beneath caught most of the water, and there were hippogriffs drinking. One side of the broad pool was notched. [SNIPPET] The wind whistled in its wings. Away to the left, the cliff fell back in a wide crescent, and nearly opposite him a river tumbled over the edge. A pool on a ledge beneath caught most of the water, and there were hippogriffs drinking. One side of the broad pool was notched. The overflow fell sheer in a white plume blown sideways by the wind. As the sun grew hotter, the hippogriffs began to settle and browse on the islands that floated past. Not far below, he noticed, a dozen or so stood drowsily on an island that was floating through the cliff's shadow toward his ledge."
1658,"Life-spans lengthen, you know, as races approach their norms."" ""Yes. But none of the others is having half the trouble that I am. Most of them, in fact, have things coming along just about the way they want them. My four planets are raising more hell than all the rest of both galaxies put together, and I know that it isn't me—next to you, I'm the most efficient operator we've got. [SNIPPET] E Like two high executives of a Tellurian corporation discussing business affairs during a chance meeting at one of their clubs, Eddore's All Highest and Gharlane, his second in command, were having the Eddorian equivalent of an after-business-hours chat. ""You did a nice job on Tellus,"" the All-Highest commended. "" On the other three, too, of course, but Tellus was so far and away the worst of the lot that the excellence of the work stands out. When the Atlantean nations destroyed each other so thoroughly I thought that this thing called 'democracy' was done away with forever, but it seems to be mighty hard to kill. However, I take it that you have this Rome situation entirely under control?"""
1659,"Of course I do,” she answered.  Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two it was not injudicious.  “Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?”  “Nonsense, I do—that’s sufficient.”  “By no means; you must say why?”  “Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.”  “Bad!” was my commentary.  “And because he is young and cheerful.” [SNIPPET] Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)  She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, “Take yourself and your dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don’t commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!”  “It’s a good opportunity, now that master is away,” I answered aloud: “he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I’m sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.”  “I hate you to be fidgeting in my presence,” exclaimed the young lady imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff."
1660,"Then, with a single comprehensive glance around: ""Besides, this sort of thing is not amusing—at least for certain natures!"" And she drew up in front of the row of armchairs, uttering a few polite remarks here and there, while some old men with double eyeglasses came to pay court to her. She introduced Frederick to some of them. M. Dambreuse touched him lightly on the elbow, and led him out on the terrace. [SNIPPET] ""Look over there! Look at my protector's wife, one of the virtuous women!"" There was a great burst of laughter all round her; and the cabriolet disappeared from view. Frederick tugged impatiently at her dress, and was on the point of flying into a passion. But Cisy was there, in the same attitude as before, and, with increased assurance, he invited Rosanette to dine with him that very evening. ""Impossible!"""
1661,"They couldn't even run. ""There's something outside,"" Jennifer said in a small voice. Her voice seemed to trigger the attack. The Zid lunged against the door with a force that cracked the wooden hurricane bolt across and opened a three-inch slit between leading edge and lintel. [SNIPPET] Unless checked, the Zid would rapidly depopulate the island—and, to check it, they must break a prime rule of Galactic protocol in asking the help of a new and untested species. But they had no choice. They teleported at once into the presence of the two nearby natives—and met with frustration beyond Ciriimian experience. Jeff Aubray glimpsed the Ciriimian ship's landing because the morning was a Oneday, and on Onedays his mission to the island demanded that he be up and about at sunrise. For two reasons: On Onedays, through some unfailing miracle of Calaxian seamanship, old Charlie Mack sailed down in his ancient Island Queen from the township that represented colonial Terran civilization in Procynian Archipelago 147, bringing supplies and gossip to last Jeff through the following Tenday. The Queen would dock at Jeff's little pier at dawn; she was never late."
1662,"He could not take the trip to Morethis; he would certainly die on the way. And what could he do there? There was no guarantee that, if there was anything to be found, he would find it, or even if he reached the planet alive, that he would go back alive. ""Won't you stay and dine with us tonight, Mr. Hubbard?"" Dyall asked. ""No—no, thank you,"" Hubbard said, feeling no necessity for making an excuse. [SNIPPET] ""You were wise. I merely retired to the country. I escaped the virus, but the rest of my family was less fortunate. I have but one remaining—my great-great-granddaughter."" ""Yes,"" Hubbard said, ""I know. It's because of her I've come to see you."""
1663,"No longer, then, could there be any doubt as to the annihilation of a considerable portion of the colony. Not merely had there been a submersion of the land, but the impression was more and more confirmed that the very bowels of the earth must have yawned and closed again upon a large territory. Of the rocky substratum of the province it became more evident than ever that not a trace remained, and a new soil of unknown formation had certainly taken the place of the old sandy sea-bottom. As it altogether transcended the powers of those on board to elucidate the origin of this catastrophe, it was felt to be incumbent on them at least to ascertain its extent.  After a long and somewhat wavering discussion, it was at length decided that the schooner should take advantage of the favorable wind and weather, and proceed at first towards the east, thus following the outline of what had formerly represented the coast of Africa, until that coast had been lost in boundless sea.  Not a vestige of it all remained; from Cape Matafuz to Tunis it had all gone, as though it had never been. [SNIPPET] For a few moments they both stood in silence, and contemplated land and sea; then, having given a last glance over the dreary panorama, they prepared to wend their way down the mountain. Before, however, they commenced their descent, they resolved to make a closer examination of the crater. They were particularly struck by what seemed to them almost the mysterious calmness with which the eruption was effected. There was none of the wild disorder and deafening tumult that usually accompany the discharge of volcanic matter, but the heated lava, rising with a uniform gentleness, quietly overran the limits of the crater, like the flow of water from the bosom of a peaceful lake."
1664,"""He is mine!—he is mine! He loves me truly."" After a time, she turned to the manuscript which her brother had brought her, and, with a far greater concentration of mind than she had thought it possible she could bring to it, considering the many painful subjects of contemplation that she might have occupied herself with, she read the pages with very great pleasure and interest. The tale was one which chained her attention both by its incidents and the manner of its recital. It commenced as follows, and was entitled, ""Hugo de Verole; or, the Double Plot."" In a very mountainous part of Hungary lived a nobleman whose paternal estates covered many a mile of rock and mountain land, as well as some fertile valleys, in which reposed a hardy and contented peasantry. The old Count de Hugo de Verole had quitted life early, and had left his only son, the then Count Hugo de Verole, a boy of scarcely ten years, under the guardianship of his mother, an arbitrary and unscrupulous woman. [SNIPPET] God knows what was he. ""We saw him place his winnings about his person—we saw the smile that curved the corners of his lips; he was calm, and we were maddened. The blood flowed temperately through his veins, but in ours it was burning lava, scorching as it went through every petty artery, and drying up all human thought—all human feeling. ""The winner left, and we tracked his footsteps. When he reached the open air, although he had taken much less than we of the intoxicating beverages that are supplied gratis to those who frequent those haunts of infamy, it was evident that some sort of inebriation attacked him; his steps were disordered and unsteady, and, as we followed him, we could perceive, by the devious track that he took, that he was somewhat uncertain of his route. ""We had no fixed motive in so pursuing this man. It was but an impulsive proceeding at the best; but as he still went on and cleared the streets, getting into the wild and open country, and among the hedge-rows, we began to whisper together, and to think that what we did not owe to fortune, we might to our own energy and courage at such a moment. ""I need not hesitate to say so, since, to hide the most important feature of my revelation from you, would be but to mock you; we resolved upon robbing him."
1665,"But how in heaven’s name have you come to this pass, Herbert?”  “It’s a long story, Villiers, and a strange one too, but you can hear it if you like.”  “Come on, then. Take my arm, you don’t seem very strong.”  The ill-assorted pair moved slowly up Rupert Street; the one in dirty, evil-looking rags, and the other attired in the regulation uniform of a man about town, trim, glossy, and eminently well-to-do. Villiers had emerged from his restaurant after an excellent dinner of many courses, assisted by an ingratiating little flask of Chianti, and, in that frame of mind which was with him almost chronic, had delayed a moment by the door, peering round in the dimly-lighted street in search of those mysterious incidents and persons with which the streets of London teem in every quarter and every hour. Villiers prided himself as a practised explorer of such obscure mazes and byways of London life, and in this unprofitable pursuit he displayed an assiduity which was worthy of more serious employment. Thus he stood by the lamp-post surveying the passers-by with undisguised curiosity, and with that gravity known only to the systematic diner, had just enunciated in his mind the formula: “London has been called the city of encounters; it is more than that, it is the city of Resurrections,” when these reflections were suddenly interrupted by a piteous whine at his elbow, and a deplorable appeal for alms. He looked around in some irritation, and with a sudden shock found himself confronted with the embodied proof of his somewhat stilted fancies. [SNIPPET] I went into the front room and the back room, and the kitchens downstairs; they were all dirty and dusty enough, as you would expect, but there was something strange about them all. I couldn’t define it to you, I only know I felt queer. It was one of the rooms on the first floor, though, that was the worst. It was a largish room, and once on a time the paper must have been cheerful enough, but when I saw it, paint, paper, and everything were most doleful."
1666,"I wish she wouldn't keep watching Junior like that. Our northwest neighbor heard positively that she's the child of an only parent!"" ""Never mind."" Pater turned to reassure her. "" Once Junior is properly rooted, his self-respect will cause him to keep riffraff at a distance. It's a matter of Psychology, my dear; the vertical position makes all the difference in one's thinking."" The great day arrived. [SNIPPET] ""Yes,"" admitted Junior. The neighbors stared. The three maiden aunts clutched one another with muted shrieks, savoring beforehand the language Pater would now use. But Pater said ""Ulp!""—no more. ""Now, dear,"" put in Mater quickly. "" We must be patient."
1667,"“When the crowd finally cleared, there was Rene. His clothes were torn, but he wasn’t hurt. Every one of the men who had attacked him had to be carried away; I think one of them was dead. Rene stood there laughing; then he saw me hidden in the darkness and he took me home. He told me that when he’d been younger he’d worked his way all the way in to Earth, and studied some of the cultures there. He’d learned karate, which was an ancient Japanese way of fighting.” Rynason took a deep breath. “ [SNIPPET] Rynason took a long swallow of his drink and put it down empty. The noise and smell of the bar seemed to grow around him, washing over him. It might have been the effects of the tarpaq in the drink, but he felt his stomach tighten and turn slightly when he thought of how Earth’s culture presented itself, warped itself, here on the frontier Edge. Was this land of mercenary, slipshod rush really what had carried Earthmen to the stars?"
1668,"It seems to have been erected only in compliance with that hunger of imagination which preys incessantly upon life, and must be always appeased by some employment. Those who have already all that they can enjoy must enlarge their desires. He that has built for use till use is supplied must begin to build for vanity, and extend his plan to the utmost power of human performance that he may not be soon reduced to form another wish. “I consider this mighty structure as a monument of the insufficiency of human enjoyments. A king p. 125whose power is unlimited, and whose treasures surmount all real and imaginary wants, is compelled to solace, by the erection of a pyramid, the satiety of dominion and tastelessness of pleasures, and to amuse the tediousness of declining life by seeing thousands labouring without end, and one stone, for no purpose, laid upon another. Whoever thou art that, not content with a moderate condition, imaginest happiness in royal magnificence, and dreamest that command or riches can feed the appetite of novelty with perpetual gratifications, survey the Pyramids, and confess thy folly!” They rose up, and returned through the cavity at which they had entered; and the Princess prepared for her favourite a long narrative of dark labyrinths and costly rooms, and of the different impressions which the varieties of the way had made upon her. But when they came to their train, they found every one silent and dejected: the men discovered shame and fear in their countenances, and the women were weeping in their tents. What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but immediately inquired. “ [SNIPPET] Whoever thou art that, not content with a moderate condition, imaginest happiness in royal magnificence, and dreamest that command or riches can feed the appetite of novelty with perpetual gratifications, survey the Pyramids, and confess thy folly!” They rose up, and returned through the cavity at which they had entered; and the Princess prepared for her favourite a long narrative of dark labyrinths and costly rooms, and of the different impressions which the varieties of the way had made upon her. But when they came to their train, they found every one silent and dejected: the men discovered shame and fear in their countenances, and the women were weeping in their tents. What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but immediately inquired. “ You had scarcely entered into the Pyramid,” said one of the attendants, “when a troop of Arabs rushed upon us: we were too few to resist them, and too slow to escape."
1669,"“That, if you will believe me, Mr. Isbister, is one of the problems most constantly before my mind. We happen to be—as a matter of fact, there are no very trustworthy connections of ours. It is a grotesque and unprecedented position.”  “It is,” said Isbister. “ As a matter of fact, it’s a case for a public trustee, if only we had such a functionary.” [SNIPPET] “The old life was not a happy one,” said Graham. “ I do not regret that.”  She looked at him quickly. There was a brief pause. She sighed encouragingly. “ No?”  “No,” said Graham. “ It was a little life—and unmeaning."
1670,"Sutter was a logical man, and even as this thought came his mind rejected it. It must be Travail. He had taken a sample shell from the basket and even now perhaps was dickering with the officials of the Federal Arts Museum on a price. Sutter picked up the bisected shell and went into the sitting room. He carefully placed the shell upon the table so that the light from the television set would fall directly upon it. Then he sat down to wait. [SNIPPET] Travail, drawing on his cigar, watched him curiously. ""What are you doing?"" he asked at length. ""Little experiment. Stand over here and I'll show you. Here, in front of this cone of light."" Travail took the place indicated. His face was emotionless as he looked beyond the light into the bisected shell."
1671,"Reginald was sitting at the writing-table in his most characteristic pose, supporting his head with his hand and looking with clear piercing eyes searchingly at the boy. ""Yes,"" he observed, ""it's a most curious psychical phenomenon."" ""You cannot imagine how real it all seemed to me."" The boy spoke painfully, dazed, as if struck by a blow. ""Even now it is as if something has gone from me, some struggling thought that I cannot—cannot remember."" [Pg 66]Reginald regarded him as a physical experimenter might look upon the subject of a particularly baffling mental disease. ""You must not think, my boy, that I bear you any malice for your extraordinary delusion. Before Jack went away he gave me an exact account of all that has happened. [SNIPPET] ""Do you remember,"" he continued, speaking to Reginald, ""the Narcissus I was working on the last time when you called at my studio?"" ""Yes; it was a striking thing and impressed me very much, though I cannot recall it at the moment."" ""Well, it was a commission. An eccentric young millionaire had offered me eight thousand dollars for it."
1672,"He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't. Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her face—no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes—that made him know she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when the music ended, he was ready to go home. They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of Phil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much, Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old self. [SNIPPET] I'm home—or that's what everyone seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that would satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or another monster from the movies."" Edith said, ""Oh, Hank, don't, don't!"" The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night."
1673,"CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.  CHAPTER 18. His Mark.  CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.  CHAPTER 20. All Astir. [SNIPPET] This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.  Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis."
1674,"I thought you had better sense. Total recall doesn’t necessarily mean a damn thing in them—but when they start telling you straightforward and cold that they’ve talked with some god, and then they throw what sounds like an anxiety fit right in front of you…. Well, what does it sound like to you?” Rynason accepted one of the drinks that the waiter banged down on the table and took a sip. He felt lightheaded. “ It would have been an anxiety fit if Horng had been human,” he said. “ But you’re right, I do know better than to judge him by our standards. No, it was something else.” “What, then?” [SNIPPET] he said. “We’re coming in, Lee. Get out of there or we’ll cut you down too.” “Manning!”"
1675,"From Miaka they would transmit to the Belderkan Preserve, a famous tourist attraction whose station could transmit to any point on the globe. Even now a dozen inspectors were taking over the Game Preserve station and manning its controls. They had made no plans to take over Miaka. They planned to get there before it could be defended. ""There's no military base near Miaka,"" Rashid said. "" [SNIPPET] Read's psych tests said pride alone drove him on. That was good enough for the UN; they only rejected men whose loyalties might conflict with their duties. But an assault on the tank required something more than a hunger for self-respect. Read had seen the inspector who covered their getaway. He had watched their escort charge three-to-one odds. He had seen another inspector stay behind at Miaka Station. And here, in this building, lay battered men and dead men. All UN inspectors."
1676,"Although weariness made their feet leaden and pressed on their eyelids, they dared not halt. Each one nursed some secret dread. Tolto thought of his princess, his child goddess, and mentally fought battle with whomever stood between him and her. Sime and Murray saw in those lights only war, swift and horrible. Tuman imagined a city full of enemies, ruthless and powerful. Gradually, as they came closer, the lights began to go out one by one. The city was going to bed. An hour later they came to an illuminated post marking the end of a street. A teletabloid was affixed to this post, buzzing, but its stereo-screen blank. [SNIPPET] ""Everything's all right!"" he shouted excitedly. Tolto, however, was listening anxiously. There was a sharp crackling at the stern, where, in a narrow space, the reaction motors provided the forward motive power. In moments of excitement he referred to himself in the third person. He did so now. ""Tolto's afraid that something's wrong! Smells hot, too!"""
1677,"We can predict when she's going to be right for our helix, which is a small part of the time, but that part we can use."" He gave me an owlish look. "" Philadelphia lawyer,"" he said. "" No other PC is geared in to the same space-time continuum that Pheola predicts, I suppose, so that means there is no way to test whether she was right or wrong about events in that other time."" ""None,"" I agreed. "" But my theory is the only one that holds any water, so far. [SNIPPET] You know he doesn't think enough of your TK to have your training extended. Well, you and I both know we have done wonders for your grip. Just because he's Grand Master doesn't make him right all the time. I want you to test this girl, and I think she has as much right to the facts as you have to the training I've been giving you under the table all these months!"" ""Blackmail,"" he said sadly. "" Extortion!"""
1678,"""Yeah."" ""Want a lift?"" ""Sure."" Actually I didn't. [SNIPPET] I'm wondering if it will really come,"" said Paul. We all squinted up. ""Where'll the President watch it from?"" I said. "" He should have a good view from the White House."" ""No better than us right here,"" said Howie. ""What about Australia?"
1679,"Bump-arch wasn't going to qualify for journeyman's rank, because he had stubbornly insisted on a demonstration that was sure to fail. It was a crazy situation, Snubnose thought. Here he himself was a full-fledged journeyman, and here was his sister a full-fledged journeywoman, while a talented fellow like Bump-arch would remain an apprentice or become a guildless outcast. For that difficulty he had nobody to blame but himself, Snubnose reflected, in the virtuous way we meditate upon the mistakes of our friends. Now the Grandmaster was introducing Crookback, Bump-arch's master, and as late as the previous Day of the Candidate, Snubnose's master as well. Snubnose looked at the old man more affectionately than he had while in his service. [SNIPPET] The vault was afterward buried by the earthquake."" ""And very conveniently too,"" Snubnose added to himself. Bump-arch had not admitted it, even to him, but Snubnose was convinced that the chamber was his friend's own invention. ""Reverence, elder ones,"" Bump-arch said and walked to the arched door of the meeting room. ""Time,"" said the Grandmaster. Snubnose, rising, heard a conversation behind him, as two master chemists shuffled to their feet. ""Do you think the youngster will do it?"""
1680,"Of what use is it, with no women to start the race afresh?"" Rolla started despite herself. Was this the reason why she, despite her savagery, had been made so welcome? ""Ye have not told me,"" said she hurriedly, ""why ye and the others all wear such curious garments when ye eat."" Somat was taken off his guard. He had been chuckling to himself at the woman's childlike mind. Now he had to look apologetic and not a little sheepish as he made reply: ""The robes are a mere custom. It were started a great many years ago, by the founders of a—a—"" He tried to think of a simpler expression than ""college fraternity."" "" [SNIPPET] Rolla did not understand. He repeated it, this time a little less commandingly; and Rolla, after swallowing desperately, inclined her head in the diffident way she had, and said: ""Are ye friends or enemies?"" Eleven of the twelve looked puzzled. The dark-haired man, who had been the first to see her, however, gave a muttered exclamation; then he cogitated a moment, wet his lips and said something that sounded like: ""What did you say? Say it again!"" Rolla repeated. The dark-haired man listened intently."
1681,"Its designation, of course, gives me certain information regarding its size, location and status, however."" ""How much information, Commander?"" asked Tipene nervously. ""Well, 'F' indicates that it is large; larger than Earth, for example. The numerals tells me where to locate it upon our space charts. And the 'X' would indicate that it is inhabited, but not by intelligent beings. Or that there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of those inhabiting it."" ""A very good summary of the knowledge we have,"" nodded Inverness approvingly. "" [SNIPPET] A sharp rap on the door of the navigating room, where we had gathered for an informal council of war, interrupted. ""Party of three civilians at the main exit port, Port Number One, sir,"" reported the sub-officer of the guard. "" One sent his name: Carlos Inverness."" ""Very good."
1682,"Here's one good example. Look over there. Donnegan's food detail is just now returning with its first load. They left three hours ago."" He yelled over to the foreman. Donnegan, a large, pleasant-faced biologist sauntered over to us. Benson said, ""Was the expedition successful?"" [SNIPPET] It rustled the grass softly and moved into the natives, only 20 yards away. The wavering line stopped again. Segments began to retreat, first singly, then in pairs and groups. All but a handful of the most curious suddenly bounded for the forest and disappeared. The others came forward again, but with increasing bewilderment. Repeatedly, they raised their noses and sniffed the air. Bailey said from behind us, ""They catch our scent and don't know what to make of it."
1683,"She looked up and said, Meow. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Bimmie's afraid she'll have kittens. That isn't what he's trying to do. September 5, 1983 Susta wanted to go down in the basement this afternoon. When I called her for supper she came up with her stomach flat. Bimmie and I went down. [SNIPPET] It doesn't show. Frankie winked at me. September 17, 1982 The cat climbed those lace curtains Bimmie's mother gave us. Bimmie said it was my job to watch him. I said, That's a stupid way to spend my life. He said, I didn't marry you to have you sit around and do nothing. Susta watched Sup and whined. She wants to be a cat. September 27, 1982 Bimmie read my diary."
1684,"Through as President, through with the Party. They'll crucify me. But somebody in authority must push this project. That's the beginning. Once it's known, people will have to think about the possibilities. There'll be opposition, then controversy, then debate. And gradually Leffingwell will gain adherents. It may take five years, it may take ten. [SNIPPET] The searchlights winked across the courtyards and the sirens vomited hysteria from metallic throats and the night was filled with shadows that pursued. But Harry knew where to run. He ran straight through the nightmare, through all the fantastic but familiar convolutions of sight and sound, and then he came to the river and plunged in. Now the nightmare was not sight or sound, but merely sensation. Icy cold and distilled darkness; ripples that ran, then raced and roiled and roared. But there had to be a way out of the nightmare and there had to be a way out of the canyon, and that way was the river. Apparently no one else had thought of the river; perhaps they had considered it as a possible avenue of escape and then discarded the notion when they realized how it ripped and raged among the rocks as it finally plunged from the canyon's mouth. Obviously, no one could hope to combat that current and survive."
1685,"There was what looked like a ten-inch TV tube in one corner of his place, not housed in a cabinet, but lying on the table among dozens of other tubes and rheostats and meters and other things I didn't know about. Along the wall that led from this corner was a lot of stuff which Perry said was high voltage, and warned me not to touch. I kept away. I wasn't trying to figure out how to get myself killed. All I wanted to know was when he saw this girl. [SNIPPET] And I didn't say she lived in Europe."" ""That's exactly what you did say. Or maybe you meant she lived on Mars?"" ""No. She's an American."""
1686,"Whaddya do on your TV show?"" ""I talk. About science. Physics. Like today, I was discussing the H-bomb. How it works, you know, and why the fallout is dangerous, and ... Oh, good Gawd! Seduce, reduce! [SNIPPET] They were more awkward than he, and so they fell behind. ""Listen, mister,"" Sheilah said. "" You're not really gonna help these creeps, are ya? Cause, I mean, if you are I'm gonna stop you—one way or another."" Wayne looked at her, feeling a deep sadness that anything so gorgeous could be so stupid. Stirred to self-consciousness by her near-nudity, he glanced quickly away. ""Why don't you quit trying to think?"" he advised her. "" I may not be able to make a high dragon bump, but so help me I'm going to do my damnedest to see that they get one."
1687,"Lord knows how much money is involved, but I know for a fact that some companies spend twenty or thirty million dollars a year on advertising. Multiply it, say, by a hundred companies. Say that every one of them learns how to cut its advertising cost by only ten per cent. And that's peanuts, believe me! ""If they know in advance what's going to work, they can cut their costs in half—maybe to less than half, I don't know. But that's saving two or three hundred million dollars a year—and if they pay only ten or twenty per cent of that for the use of Tylerton, it's still dirt cheap for them and a fortune for whoever took over Tylerton."" [SNIPPET] And then he just stood there silently, watching Burckhardt's face, with a burning eagerness that dwindled to a faint hope and died to a regret. He was searching for something, waiting for something, Burckhardt thought. But whatever it was he wanted, Burckhardt didn't know how to supply it. Burckhardt coughed and said again, ""Hello, Swanson."" Swanson didn't even acknowledge the greeting. He merely sighed a very deep sigh. ""Nothing doing,"" he mumbled, apparently to himself. He nodded abstractedly to Burckhardt and turned away."
1688,"""How did Jap beetles get here?"" I ask Wurpz. I shiver. I think of all the Subterro subs pouring out of a hole under Brazil and sinking all Earthian merchant marines, and shooting guided missiles that will land all over the U.S. They could have rays that would reach up over a million miles and wash up space traffic. Then we get another jolt. They bring us our chow and say it is angleworm and hellgrammite porridge as that is what the Subterro denizens live on mostly. [SNIPPET] ""Of course you can count on me,"" Zahooli says. "" When do we start building this mechanical mole?"" ""In just two days,"" I says. "" Our backers have purchased an extinct spaceship factory not far from Commonwealth Seven. Yeah, we will call our project 'Operation Earthworm,' pal."" D'Ambrosia sits down and starts looking chicken. "" We wouldn't get no astrogator in his right mind to go with us, Sep. How many times the thrust will we need over what we would use if we was just cutting space?"
1689,"The unfortunate candidate could either serve another five years of apprenticeship and try again, or give up all connection with the Guild. If he left the Guild of Scientists, he couldn't be admitted in any other Guild. Which was no laughing matter. Only journeymen and masters and kingsmen—in the general sense, both men and women—had full rights of citizens, including the right to marry by Public Law. [SNIPPET] ""Oh little gods. Whatever we can't do any more is impossible and a myth. We just won't admit we are not as good scientists as our remote ancestors. But some of us are as good, or even better.""

Wait till he finishes another apprenticeship and hope mother changes her mind meanwhile? And then he would probably come up with another impossible demonstration."
1690,"Yes, that is our dream: to turn all earth into the Vale of Ajalon at our pleasure. So far, we can drag out the dawn to twice its normal length in these latitudes. But some day—even on the Equator—we shall hold the Sun level in his full stride. Now we look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic. A big submersible breaks water suddenly. Another and another follow with a swash and a suck and a savage bubbling of relieved pressures.

O'Hare tensed, psy-blinked his view screen down to the instruments vital to his immediate mission, and mind-keyed several controls. The fifteen-meters-long vessel, with a barely two-meter beam, swooped low and snapped into its run barely fifteen meters across Pluto's desolate plains. The view screen readouts showed subsurface galleries, several outlined in irregular outlines but empty, others reflected high-mass warship configurations. He focused to adjust his instruments for deeper penetration. Quite suddenly, O'Hare's vision blurred."
1693,"Kutrov was watching him, too, and I saw now that there would be a most-likely permanent digression. Too bad—I'd had a feeling that when he came to his point, it would have been a strong one.

[SNIPPET] He had not taken off his gloves, and I wondered if he would come forth with a monocle; if he had, it would not have seemed an affectation. ""I wouldn't say Slavic,"" Alva said. He started off on ethnology, and we toured the Near East again. I jumped into the break when Kutrov was swallowing beer and Alva lighting a cigaret to observe that Fayliss reminded me of some Egyptian portraits—although I couldn't set the period. """
1694,"In vain I contended with inveterate habits. I disguised to myself the impropriety of my conduct, by recollecting the benefits which it might produce. Pleyel's proposal was unwise, yet it was enforced with plausible arguments and indefatigable zeal. Your brother might be puzzled and wearied, but could not be convinced. I conceived that to terminate the controversy in favor of the latter was conferring a benefit on all parties. For this end I profited by an opening in the conversation, and assured them of Catharine's irreconcilable aversion to the scheme, and of the death of the Saxon baroness. [SNIPPET] Next morning, at breakfast, Pleyel related an event which my disappearance had hindered him from mentioning the night before. Early the preceding morning, his occasions called him to the city; he had stepped into a coffee-house to while away an hour; here he had met a person whose appearance instantly bespoke him to be the same whose hasty visit I have mentioned, and whose extraordinary visage and tones had so powerfully affected me. On an attentive survey, however, he proved, likewise, to be one with whom my friend had had some intercourse in Europe. This authorised the liberty of accosting him, and after some conversation, mindful, as Pleyel said, of the footing which this stranger had gained in my heart, he had ventured to invite him to Mettingen. The invitation had been cheerfully accepted, and a visit promised on the afternoon of the next day.  This information excited no sober emotions in my breast. I was, of course, eager to be informed as to the circumstances of their ancient intercourse. When, and where had they met?"

1696,"Towahg had heard them before, but Chet had not understood his signs. And now the chorus of an approaching pack of ape-men was louder with each passing minute. That they were coming along the same trail seemed certain. Towahg sprang into the air; his gnarled hands closed on a heavy vine: he went up this hand over hand, ready to move off to one side through the leafy roof with never a sign of his going. He waited impatiently for Chet to join him, and the pilot, regarding the incredible leap of that squat ape-man body, shook his head in despair. [SNIPPET] Fire Valley had been the home of the ape-men. On that earlier journey Walt and Chet had seen them, had fought with the tribe, and had lived for a time in their caves that made dark shadows high on the rock wall. And they knew that the wood the ape-men used for their spears was well suited for bows. Back in the caves they found discarded spears and some wood that had been gathered for shafts. Tough, springy, flexible, it was a simple matter for the men to convert these into serviceable weapons. Sinews that the ape-men had torn from great beasts made the bowstrings, and there were other slim shafts that they notched, then sharpened in the fire. Yet, to Chet as he worked, came an overwhelming feeling of despondency. To be fashioning crude weapons like these—preparing to defend themselves as best they could from the dangers of this new, raw world! No, it could not be true.... And he knew while he protested that it was all in vain."
1697,"It clung to him for a second or two, and then swung to the other guard. The guards in a puff of spectral light were gone. Tolla stood wavering; then swung her light toward Tako and Don. But I was upon her. “Tolla! Good God—” “Get back from me! [SNIPPET] The giant made a lunge and broke away from us, heedless that Don might have shot him. “What’s all this? I say, you three, what are you up to?” The policeman came on a run. A group of soldiers passing on bicycles, flung the machines aside and came dashing at us. The giant stood suddenly docile. “Officer, these young men attacked me.” “He’s a liar!” Don shouted. “"
1698,"With every muscle starting to the strain, the Doomsman whirled his enemy's body once, twice, and thrice, at full sweep about his head, then downward into crushing contact with the pavement. A final superhuman effort, and the inert mass[Pg 260] was hurled clean over the heads of the on-lookers, falling with the dead sound of over-ripe fruit against the wall of the White Tower. A full minute passed, and still every eye remained fixed on Dom Gillian. He had not moved, except to turn his head again in the direction of the light—a dumb instinct like to the compass-needle that seeks the magnetic pole. A colossal statue, but Constans fancied that it was swaying at its base, then he saw the great chest heave convulsively and a bubble of reddish foam issuing at his lips. But the man was dying hard; in another moment he had straightened up, and was resolutely swallowing back the salty, suffocating tide, beating the air with his hands as he strove for breath. Only for an instant, however, for now the tide had become a flood, and, with a little fretful moan, like to that of a tired child, Dom Gillian, Overlord of Doom, sank to earth, not falling headlong, as does a felled tree, but quietly settling into a heap, just as an empty bag collapses into itself. [SNIPPET] He felt his way to the secret door; the wainscot screen stood ajar. It was plain that some one had come to the Rat's-Hole only to discover that the key of the outside door was missing. Constans realized that he, too, had missed something—his chance to get to the bottom of the mystery. Shame on such a sentinel! Without any definite plan of action, Constans made his way to the lower hall. The moonbeams were pouring a flood of light through the east windows and he could see plainly. The peddler's couch was empty, save for his gabardine of gray and the false hair that had served him for a beard. There were two figures dimly visible in the obscurity of the vaulted entrance to the water gate."
1699,"Blushing was an art they practised little. The shyness thou so lovest in a Persian maiden was to them an unknown thing. Our shrinking daughters bear no resemblance to these Western products. They strode the public streets with roving eyes and unblushing faces, holding free converse with men as with women, bold of speech and free of manner, going and coming as it pleased them best. They knew much of the world, managed their own affairs, and devised their own marriages, often changing their minds and marrying another than the betrothed."" [SNIPPET] I harbor a suspicion that it causes Nōfūhl some pleasure to sit upon the cool deck of the Zlōtuhb and watch Bhoz-jā-khāz walking to and fro upon the ruins of a distant wharf.  A Street Scene in Ancient Nhu-Y  [The costumes and manner of riding are taken from metal plates now in the museum at Teheran] 19th M he air is cooler. Grip-til-lah thinks a storm is brewing. Even Nōfūhl is puzzled over the wooden image we brought aboard yesterday. It is well preserved, with the barbaric coloring still fresh upon it."
1700,"Do you hear?"" ""But, Aunt Matilda!"" I protested. In the end I had to get out or she would have had a stroke. She was shaking like a leaf, her skin mottled and her eyes wild, as I went down the front steps with my bag. [SNIPPET] The reason for that is that my surroundings, no matter in what direction I look, are exactly identical with my real surroundings. My physical surroundings are duplicated exactly in all my portraits, just as Aunt Matilda's are in the portrait of her that hangs on my study wall. She is the invariant of each of her iconic Mantrams and her surroundings are the variables that enter and leave the screen. I am the invariant in my own portraits, wherever they are. So, except for the slight twist in my mind that takes place when I shift, that I have learned to recognize from practice in front of my ""mirror"" each morning when I shave, and except for the portrait of Aunt Matilda, I would never be able to suspect what happens. If Lana had taken my picture without my knowing it and I had never seen one of her collection of portraits, nor ever heard of an iconic Mantram, I would have absolutely nothing to go on to suspect the truth that I know."
1701,"Vaguely, he became aware that the creature had gotten up, and he turned a small part of his attention to the action. Longtree smiled inwardly, pleased, and turned yellow with pride to think even a man from another planet should so appreciate his symphony that he got up and danced a strange dance and even sang to the music. The alien held onto his ears and leaped erratically, singing, ""No, no, stop it. It's too high. My head's bursting!"" Channeljumper too seemed pleased by this show of appreciation, though neither of them understood the words, and Longtree swept into the final notes of the rising crescendo with a gusto he had not previously displayed. He stopped where he had always stopped—and the final note came! [SNIPPET] Wonder what they want."" Channeljumper shrugged to indicate he didn't know. "" The short-haired one followed me,"" he said. Longtree felt the chill blue of fear creep along his spine, but immediate anger at himself changed it conveniently to purple, and he was certain Channeljumper hadn't noticed. When he had controlled himself, he said, ""Well, it doesn't matter. I've got to get on with my symphony. That last note—"" ""He's here,"" Channeljumper announced."
1702,"""I was dumb for a long time,"" Karyl said. "" I thought that it was the acid, almost to the very last. But when I drank that last glass, I knew they didn't have a chance. ""They were metal monsters. No wonder they feared that liquid. It would rust their joints, short their wiring, and kill them. [SNIPPET] Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts quickly. They can delve deeper than the surface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a leash on my thoughts? The Steel-Blue chuckled. "" You get—absent-minded, is it?—every once in a while."" Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared lugging great sheets of plastic and various other equipment. They dumped their loads and began unbundling them. Working swiftly, they built a plastic igloo, smaller than the living room in the larger service station igloo. They ranged instruments inside—one of them Jon Karyl recognized as an air pump from within the station—and they laid out a pallet."
1703,"Or Beelzebub."" All at once we hear a big rumbling noise and the plexidomed house we are in shakes and rattles and we are knocked out of our chairs and deposited on the seats of our corylon rompers. The viso-screen blacks out, I get to all fours and ask, ""You think the Nougatines have gone to war again, D'Ambrosia?"" ""It was not mice,"" Zahooli gulps. "" It is either a hydroradium plant backfired or a good old-fashioned earthquake."" [SNIPPET] ""Is that impossible? You have seen those ancient sailing ships built inside of a bottle, Mr. Zmorro,"" I says. He paws at his dome and takes a hyperbenzadrine tablet. "" Well, thank you, Septimus Spink. And have a good trip."" It is Friday. We climb up the ladder and into the Magnificent Mole. "" Check everything,"" I says to Wurpz. """
1704,"Your ancestors didn’t think anybody could be smart unless they were old. Of course, that’s all changed now.” He paused and nodded twice. “ Oh, I’ve managed to fix myself up a good deal; I’m not in nearly as bad shape as I was at first, but that’s all inside. [SNIPPET] This is a spaceship, isn’t it?” The huddled figure in the wheelchair cackled in a brief laugh. “ I’ve been hoping that somebody would get up enough nerve someday to ask that kind of question,” it said. “ Yep, this is a spaceship. And a darned big one.” “How did you happen to land on this planet?” “Had an accident. Didn’t want to land here, but there wasn’t any choice. Made a mighty good landing, considering everything."
1705,"""Well, what has that to do with it?"" ""Just this much: if you follow any farther, you'll get into the woods, and there you'll be, going round and round, like a squirrel in a cage, without being able to get out, and you will there get none of the good things included under the head of those meals."" ""I think so too,"" said the third. ""Well, then, let's go back; we needn't run, though it might be as well to do so."" ""It would be anything but well. I don't gallop back, depend upon it."" The three men now slowly returned from their useless chase, and re-trod the way they had passed once in such a hurry that they could hardly recognize it. ""What a dreadful bump I came against that pole standing there,"" said one. [SNIPPET] London Sep. 1           ——""How graves give up their dead."
1706,"Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again: “Do you know what day it is?” [SNIPPET] 30 October, evening.—They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the “Traveller’s” typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write with a pen. It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts."
1707,"Those gates were sufficiently strong to resist the first vigorous shake which was given to them by some of the foremost among the crowd, and then one fellow started the idea that they might be opened from the inside, and volunteered to clamber over the wall to do so. Hoisted up upon the shoulders of several, he grasped the top of the wall, and raised his head above its level, and then something of a mysterious nature rose up from the inside, and dealt him such a whack between the eyes, that down he went sprawling among his coadjutors. Now, nobody had seen how this injury had been inflicted, and the policy of those in the garrison should have been certainly to keep up the mystery, and leave the invaders in ignorance of what sort of person it was that had so foiled them. Man, however, is prone to indulge in vain glorification, and the secret was exploded by the triumphant waving of the long staff of the beadle, with the gilt knob at the end of it, just over the parapet of the wall, in token of victory. ""It's Waggles! [SNIPPET] ""—""Perhaps not; but, however, to make a long story short, somehow or other, one day, Belinda was sitting alone, and I rudely pounced upon her; I rather think then I must have said something that I oughtn't to have said, for it took her so aback; I was forced, somehow or other, to hold her up, and then I—I—yes; I'm sure I kissed her; and so, I told her I loved her; and then, what do you think she said?"" ""Why,"" said Flora, ""that she reciprocated the passion. ""—""D—n my rags,"" said Jack, who at the moment came into the room, ""I suppose that's the name of some shell or other."" ""You here, you villain!"" said the admiral; ""I thought you were gone. ""—""So I was,"" said Jack, ""but I came back for my hat, you see."" Away he went again, and the admiral resumed his story."
1708,"Mary turned the back of her father’s hand to her lips and smiled at him.  “Well, well, nobody’s perfect, but”—here Mr. Garth shook his head to help out the inadequacy of words—“what I am thinking of is—what it must be for a wife when she’s never sure of her husband, when he hasn’t got a principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by others than of getting his own toes pinched. That’s the long and the short of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before they know what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can only get together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear. [SNIPPET] he said, pressing her hand between his hands, “this is a happiness greater than I had ever imagined to be in reserve for me. That I should ever meet with a mind and person so rich in the mingled graces which could render marriage desirable, was far indeed from my conception. You have all—nay, more than all—those qualities which I have ever regarded as the characteristic excellences of womanhood. The great charm of your sex is its capability of an ardent self-sacrificing affection, and herein we see its fitness to round and complete the existence of our own. Hitherto I have known few pleasures save of the severer kind: my satisfactions have been those of the solitary student. I have been little disposed to gather flowers that would wither in my hand, but now I shall pluck them with eagerness, to place them in your bosom.”  No speech could have been more thoroughly honest in its intention: the frigid rhetoric at the end was as sincere as the bark of a dog, or the cawing of an amorous rook."
1709,"""Oh, sure, if that's all there is wrong. But I'd rather do the work with the motors retracted. Tell you what; retract them about forty-five degrees when I give the word."" Mac judged the distance the booms would cover during semiretraction and half floated, half crawled out of the way. He found himself breathing heavily, despite the freeload conditions. His suit was simply too cumbersome. [SNIPPET] Auxiliary motor system; you'll find them under power plant."" Months before, MacNamara had made a complete set of tape recordings of his own voice, recorded as he made a thorough-going rundown of every system and its components. This was a personal innovation which his fellow flight engineers considered folly. Extra weight, they scoffed. Undue complication. Mac nodded and went on with his impromptu speechmaking; a professional psychiatrist might have said, correctly, that Mac felt an unconscious need for supervision, a forgivable deficiency dating back to his cadet days. Mac simply claimed that the best of men could forget or omit when alone with a few million dollars' worth of Uncle's equipment. This way he could remind himself of each step to be taken ahead of time, in his own way. The co-pilot rushed to comply."
1710,"""Horses in here,"" said Sergeant Walpole. "" The Wabbly came by. No people left."" They brought the animals out. The horses reared and plunged as there were other infinitely sharp, deadly explosions of the eggs coming down eight miles through darkness. ""Let's go. After the Wabbly?"" [SNIPPET] ""No good,"" said the 'copter man briefly. "" Vesicatory. Smell it? I guess they've got us."
1711,"Not many men had such opportunity to realize their dreams of perfection. To cap the triumph Dirrul knew it might still be possible to make his report and save the Movement on Agron. From the top of a purple-swathed knoll he looked down across a twisting red stream toward the suburbs of the city. Magnificent black-stone villas, surrounded by stylized gardens, were on both sides of the green highway. Further on, close to the city, were the crowded workers' quarters, behind them, hidden in a faint mist, the rectangular masses of public buildings reaching up toward the stars. This was as Paul Sorgel had so often described it. Such grandeur could only belong to the capital city of the Vininese Confederacy. Under the brow of the knoll Dirrul saw one of the stone block buildings within its protective double walls. [SNIPPET] Dirrul accepted. As soon as the professor had gone his fear vanished. What he had said to Dr. Kramer gave away no secrets and, in any case, he was crediting the professor with a perception he did not have. Ever since first joining the Movement, when he was still in school, Dirrul had taken such pains to conceal his motives that it would have required a good deal more than Dr. Kramer's clumsy prying to reveal them. He had deliberately patterned his attitudes and habits upon a composite average, even to a mild and starry-eyed criticism of the system which was more or less expected from the ambitious young men of the Air-command. Dr. Kramer's ecstatic praise of the system was the typical emotional reaction of the older generation. The professor may actually have been convinced of the truth of his own fuzzy propaganda."
1712,"His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.  He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.  Miss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. [SNIPPET] It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece."
1713,"More applause—this time unrestrained. Fayliss smiled again and swept his eyes around us, as if filled with some amusing secret. Then he said to Kutrov, ""You would find them quite understandable."" I wandered over to the window, in search of air, and noted that someone had indiscreetly left a comfortable chair vacant. I was near the door, so that I could hear Jocelyn say to Fayliss: ""It was—very moving. Why, I could almost feel that you were singing about us."" Fayliss smiled again. "" That is as it should be."" ""Of course,"" chimed in Loring, who'd come up to ask Fayliss if he could have a copy of the score, ""that's the test of expert performance."" [SNIPPET] But I couldn't see his eyes at all. Then a gust of wind tugged his hat, and, for an instant I thought he'd have to go scrambling after it. But, quick as a rapier thrust, a tail darted out from beneath his dress coat, caught the hat, and set it back upon his head."
1714,"Sight of its illusive form could always sweep away his doubts; straighten his shoulders. The intercom buzzed. Joshua went over and snapped it. "" Yes?"" ""Mr. Coving to see you, sir."" ""Send him in."" Rayburn Coving was probably the best rocket-fuel man in the world. He had a little of his sandy hair left, not much, and his forehead was permanently creased from frowning. "" I'm afraid that new benzoic derivative is a failure, Chief. [SNIPPET] The last, crude insult? Lee Gorman's wounds must have been deep indeed. Joshua served drinks, brought sandwiches. Lee Gorman's geniality kept the awkwardness of the situation from bringing it to a complete standstill. "" Well, Thursday is the day, I understand. How do you feel about it?"
1715,"We are going to make them feel our strength. We are going to strike back."" Henry Woods sprang to his feet. ""How?"" he shouted. "" Have you...?"" Dr. White nodded. [SNIPPET] Come and I will show you."" The machine was huge, but it had an appearance of simple construction. A large rectangular block of what appeared to be a strange black metal was set on end and flanked on each side by two smaller ones. On the top of the large block was set a half-globe of a strange substance, somewhat, Henry thought, like frosted glass. On one side of the large cube was set a lever, a long glass panel, two vertical tubes and three clock-face indicators. The control board, it appeared, was relatively simple. Beside the mass of the five rectangles, on the floor, was a large plate of transparent substance, ground to a concave surface, through which one could see an intricate tangle of wire mesh. Hanging from the ceiling, directly above the one on the floor, was another concave disk, but this one had a far more pronounced curvature."
1716,"""Let's have it anyway."" ""His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For some reason you can't get off this planet."" That was startling information, though not strictly true. [SNIPPET] ""That's what I said. Consider it this way. I've seen my tab a countless number of times. If I tried to draw it as I remember it, it would be inept and wouldn't pass. Nevertheless, that memory is in my mind, recorded in neuronic chains, exact and accurate."" He paused significantly. """
1717,"The machine? Well, I dunno what to do with it. If Carter ever comes back he might not like my getting rid of it. I was thinking mebbe I'd put it in the hobby show at the county fair next week, though. Ya notice how that funny-looking cube inside there gets bigger every time you look at it? There ... it just doubled its size again, see? People at the fair oughtta get a big kick outta that. No telling how big it'll get with all those people looking at it. [SNIPPET] The shutter of a movie camera is closed as much of the time as it is open. What happens in between the times it's open? ""You know,"" he went on, ""people used to think matter and motion were continuous, but scientists have proved that they are discontinuous. Now some of them think time may be, too."
1718,"In the partially bared ruins the outline of a small village could be seen; the detailed excavation would be done this summer by workmen who would arrive from Phoenix and Tucson. George stopped their caravan and the two men got out, stretching their legs. They looked about, both more interested in the dig, now they were back at it, than setting up camp. They walked around, examining various parts of it, and the excitement of the promise of things to be discovered in the earth came to them. "" [SNIPPET] On it rested Huk's aspergill. ""He gave it to me,"" Sidney explained. George placed Good Fox's netted clay water jug and his atlatl and furred quiver of lances on the table, together with the pictures he had taken of the ancient Indians. They waited."
1719,"Half your universe we have already deprived of its ores. Your Earth has more that we want. Then we shall continue on our way, to loot the rest of the worlds, before passing on to another universe. We are a planet without a universe. We will wander and pillage until we find a universe like the one we come from, or until Xlarbti itself disintegrates and we perish. ""We could easily wipe out all the dwellers on Earth and mine the ores ourselves. [SNIPPET] They had, moreover, singular properties which could not be described, as if a new force were embodied in them. Hour after hour humanity watched the spectacular progress of the dark star, watched those mysterious and threatening paths of light that flowed from the invader. When dawn came, it brought only a great fear and the oppression of impending disaster. In the early morning, Phobar slept. When he awoke, he felt refreshed and decided to take a short walk in the familiar and peaceful light of day. He never took that walk. He opened the door on a kind of dim and reddish twilight."
1720,"I nudged them with my fingers. They hustled along a little faster, as if appreciative of the help, even coming from me. I saw they were moving faster, as if they were learning as they tried it. I turned one of them around. [SNIPPET] So if the Army didn't want trouble with the Civil Courts, all brought about because the lieutenant didn't know how to handle his man— The lieutenant became immediately anxious to coöperate with me. So then I soothed him. I told him that, naturally, the Swami was unhappy."
1721,"While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them, one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep side of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building. The loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out. There it lay in the gutter just under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting. Such a winking and blinking were never before seen. This behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart. I was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just under my nose. [SNIPPET] here interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “ Please keep your feet to yourself! You have spoiled my brocade! Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style? Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this."
1722,"And I had duration because I knew that time had elapsed since the moment I awakened though I had no means of telling how much time or of even naming the period. Could I really be pure reason? Can reason exist? Can rational entity exist without a groundwork of matter, or at least of force? It could. It must. [SNIPPET] It knocked me out for a moment. I had the damnedest impression—"" ""Remember what you promised!"" She swiveled the seat about to face him. """
1723,"Is this a necessity, a condition peculiar to me as I am, as reason, or is it a condition that came across the barrier with me from that other state? It must be the latter. An entity of pure reason, having come into existence as reason, would need nothing but himself. Why? Because he would be without emotion. ""I am emotional,"" I thought. "" I am entity of almost pure reason, but I have inherited emotion from my previous state. It is a disorder of thought, but it can be a pleasant disorder when the emotion is the right one; or, if unpleasant, when satisfied. [SNIPPET] It is a sickness in space like—like our loneliness."" I knew the comparison was ridiculous but I let it pass. "" You said you came alive at great speed. I could have been traveling too. We must have plunged into this barrier. It seems to me that emotions must originate in a physical being; perhaps reason could be free, but not emotion. I don't know."
1724,"“He has, then, charged me to take it from you.”  “How! What do you say?”  “That my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for the suspected paper, even on the person of your Majesty.”  “What horror!” cried the queen.  “Be kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.”  “The conduct is infamously violent! [SNIPPET] Supper was served. Milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength. She did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacingly—for large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky, and distant lightning announced a storm.  The storm broke about ten o’clock. Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart. The thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts. It appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves. She howled as the hurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature, which also seemed to groan with despair.  All at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars."
1725,"Hendricks will accompany me, if it seems expeditious to leave the ship, leaving you in command here.""  ""Very well, sir!"" I knew the arrangement didn't suit him, but he was too much the perfect officer to protest, even with a glance. And besides, at the moment, he was very busy with orders to the men in the control room, forward, as he conned the ship to the place he had selected to set her down.  But busy as he was, he did not forget the order to tune up the disintegrator-ray generators.    While the great circular door of the Ertak was backing out ponderously from its threaded seat, suspended by its massive gimbals, I inspected the people of this new world.  My first impression was that they were a soldiery people, for there were no jostling crowds swarming around the ship, such as might have been expected. [SNIPPET] I thank you!""    I was perspiring and red-faced by the time I finished, and I caught Hendricks in the very act of grinning at his commander's discomfiture. One black scowl wiped that grin off so quickly, however, that I thought I must have imagined it.  ""How was that, Artur?"" I asked. "" All right?""  ""Your words were good to hear, John Hanson,"" he nodded gravely. """
1726,"It was at the same time a boon and a trial for Rynason and the rest of the survey team. They were trained archaeologists … as well schooled as possible on the worlds of this far-flung sector near the constantly outward-moving Edge, the limit of Terran expansion. Rynason could operate and if necessary repair the portable carbondaters of the team, he knew the fine points of excavation and restoration of artifacts and had studied so many types of alien anatomy that he could make at least an educated guess at the reconstruction of beings from fragmentary fossil-remains or incomplete skeletons … or exoskeletons. But the situation on Hirlaj was one which had never before been encountered; here he was not dealing with a dead race’s remains, but directly with members of that race. It was not a matter of sifting fragmentary evidence of science, crafts and customs, finding out what he could and piecing together a composite picture from the remains at hand, as they had done with the artifacts of the Outsiders, those unknown beings who had left the ruins of their outposts and colonies in six galaxies already explored and settled by the Earthmen; all he had to do here was ask the right questions and he would get his answers. Sitting there under that massive dome, with the quiet-eyed alien before him, Rynason couldn’t completely suppress a feeling of ridiculousness. The problem was that the Hirlaji could not be depended upon to be able to find a particular memory-series in their minds; the race memory was such a conglomeration that all they could do was strike randomly at memories until the correct area was touched, and then follow up from there. The result was usually irrelevant and unrelated information. [SNIPPET] THE DAY AFTER. TEBRON COMMUNICATED WITH KOR IMMEDIATELY AFTER OUSTING REPLACING THE PRIESTS. Rynason watched Horng’s replies as they were recorded by the interpreter; he was frowning. So this dawn-era king was supposed to have spoken, perhaps telepathically, with the god of the Hirlaji. Could he have simply claimed to have done so in an effort to stabilize his own power? But the fact that this race was telepathic threw some doubt on that supposition. “Are there memories of Tebron’s conversation with Kor?”"
1727,"He was mid-twenty now, old enough to want a wife and children. ""You going to raise a litter, Joe?"" Hill started. Karl realized that he had probably been thinking of the same thing. ""One of these days I'll need help around the sawmill,"" Hill answered defensively. "" [SNIPPET] ""Very nice shot, Claude."" Escher looked up and leaned the club against the side of the desk. ""I thought so, too,"" he agreed. "" What brings you here, Mac?"" MacDonald sat down and poured himself a glass of water from the beaker on Escher's desk."
1728,"Anger, frustration flared in him. His hand shot out, gun at ready. He turned around slowly. Through the settling trail of suspended sand, nothing was visible. Again he was moving. Something made his legs move. He walked on through the shrouds of Death until he felt a taut singing in his nerves. An irrational fear sprang out in him, cascading down his spine, and Cully shuddered. Ahead there was something. [SNIPPET] calls; get there because you must. Where is it? The mind-voice was excited, demanding. Something was out there, besides the sameness. Cully walked on, trailing gold. The death-curtain parted . An undulating garden of blue-and-gold streamers suddenly drifted toward him on an unfelt current. Cully was held, entranced. They flowed before him, their colors dazzling, hypnotic."
1729,That’s not flesh and blood. ( Pulling its nose.) [Pg 23]Stella. It seems to want to explain something. Jack. It will never get the chance of that. ( Lighting a candle from mantel R.) [SNIPPET] Comes down.) I’ve forgotten these telegrams. Stella. I’ll take them. Jack (gives them). Have you any cash? Stella.
1730,"The red glow seems to flicker a little."" Closer the ship floated. Closer. To right and left of them for vast distances stretched the red area. Ahead of them for hundreds of miles they knew it extended. ""We're right on it now,"" called Brand. "" Right on it—we're going over the edge—we're—"" [SNIPPET] ""Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's gravity?"" Again Brand shrugged. "" I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as mine."" He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise."
1731,"Another uniformed man came and took the weapon from the limp hand of the other, who began to explain dejectedly in a low voice while the music mounted and covered his words and the screen slowly went blank, like a window that slowly filmed over with gray fog. The music faded. In the dark, someone clapped appreciatively. The earphoned man beside the Times shifted his earphones back from his ears and spoke briskly. "" [SNIPPET] The environment evolves the animal. But only in relative terms, of course."" He looked at them with a quick glance and then looked away evasively, his lank black hair beginning to cling to his forehead with sweat. "" That doesn't necessarily mean anything."" ""Earth-like,"" muttered a reporter, writing it down as if he had noticed nothing more in the reply. The Times man glanced at the Herald, wondering if he had noticed, and received a quick glance in exchange. The Herald asked Nathen, ""You think they are dangerous, then?"""
1732,"""Nonsense,"" the boss insisted. "" You're first and foremost a talented neuro man, and that's exactly what we need in the Pro department. There, you see, the problem is primarily one of duplicating a nervous mechanism in the metal, of bridging the gap between the neuronic and electronic. So buckle down, and if you hear any more gossip about MS, forget it fast—it's not a proper subject of conversation for you. The loyalty oath you signed is very specific about the trouble you can get into with loose talk. Remember that."" [SNIPPET] It's all on a voluntary basis, you see. Democratic."" ""Whole new concept of war,"" Kujack agreed. "" Voluntary amputeeism, voluntary paraplegia, voluntary everything else that usually happens to people in a war. Just to get some human dignity back into the thing."""
1733,"He makes a fierce red flame there!  Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.  Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must properly belong to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he’s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades; there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.  Sir?  Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern. [SNIPPET] the small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a good slippering for my misbehavior; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bedside."
1734,"It was Jill's voice. ""Yeah."" That was Dio. "" The trouble is, where?"" The footsteps halted. [SNIPPET] In the barracks."" Out from the cleft where Mel Gray worked, across the flat plain of rock stripped naked by the wind that raved across it, lay the deep valley that sheltered the heart of the Moulton Project. Hot springs joined to form a steaming river. Vegetation grew savagely under the huge sun. The air, kept at almost constant temperature by the blanketing effect of the hot springs, was stagnant and heavy. But up above, high over the copper cables that crossed every valley where men ventured, the eternal wind of Mercury screamed and snarled between the naked cliffs. Three concrete domes crouched on the valley floor, housing barracks, tool-shops, kitchens, store-houses, and executive quarters, connected by underground passages."
1735,"Ask Karamy,"" he said gleefully, ""She will tell!"" ""She will?"" I said stupidly, because I could think of nothing else to say. Evarin's grin was delicately malicious. "" Oh, I am sure of that! Karamy is quick to strike. Gamine and I have little love lost, but we agree on one thing; that Karamy's procession of slaves is monstrous. And that you are a fool to help Karamy pay for her—desires. Karamy is far too fond of power in her own hands, to pay to put it into yours."" [SNIPPET] He had become old, mortal, weak—and had been eliminated. I bowed my head, although I had no personal guilt. Afterward, Narayan and I had been bound. "" I slept in the Dreamer's Keep—"" Narayan sounded reflective, almost guilty, ""I was wakened, and—given sacrifice. I learned to use my power and to give it up to Adric."" A brooding horror was in the grey eyes; I realized that Narayan dwelt in his own personal private hell with the memory of what he had done under the spell of Narabedla. """
1736,"For I know that she loves me a little. And thinking of this, he kissed her, quietly, as one might comfort a sobbing child; afterward he held her in his arms for a moment, wondering vaguely at the pliant thickness of her hair and the sweet scent of it. Then he put her from him gently, and swore in his soul that Hugues must die, so that this woman might be Adhelmar's. ""You will save him?"" Mélite asked, and raised her face to his. There was that in her eyes which caused Adhelmar to muse for a little on the nature of women's love, and, subsequently, to laugh harshly and make vehement utterance. ""Yes!"" said Adhelmar. He demanded how many of Hugues' men were about. [SNIPPET] Down the Rue Saint Jacques came Philippe Sermaise, like a questing hound, with drunken Jehan le Merdi at his heels. "" Holy Virgin!"" thought François; ""this is likely to be a nasty affair. I would give a deal for a glimpse of the patrol lanterns just now."" He edged his way toward the cloister, to get a wall at his back."
1737,"“Raffles!” exclaimed Mr. Hopkins. “ I furnished his funeral yesterday. He was buried at Lowick. Mr. Bulstrode followed him. A very decent funeral.” There was a strong sensation among the listeners. Mr. Bambridge gave an ejaculation in which “brimstone” was the mildest word, and Mr. Hawley, knitting his brows and bending his head forward, exclaimed, “What?—where did the man die?”  “At Stone Court,” said the draper. “ [SNIPPET] “No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies meddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”  Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some special reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in his mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other fragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on her."
1738,"with such a conclusion As had of his avision Croesus, that was the king of Lyde,<4> That high upon a gibbet died; This prayer shall he have of me; I am *no bet in charity.* * no more charitable*  Now hearken, as I have you said, What that I mette ere I abraid,* *awoke Of December the tenthe day; When it was night to sleep I lay, Right as I was wont for to do’n, And fell asleepe wonder soon, As he that *weary was for go*<5> *was weary from going* On pilgrimage miles two To the corsaint* Leonard, *relics of <6> To make lithe that erst was hard. But, as I slept, me mette I was Within a temple made of glass; In which there were more images Of gold, standing in sundry stages, And more riche tabernacles, And with pierrie* more pinnacles, *gems And more curious portraitures, And *quainte manner* of figures *strange kinds* Of golde work, than I saw ever. But, certainly, I wiste* never *knew Where that it was, but well wist I It was of Venus readily, This temple; for in portraiture I saw anon right her figure Naked floating in a sea, <7> And also on her head, pardie, Her rose garland white and red, And her comb to comb her head, Her doves, and Dan Cupido, Her blinde son, and Vulcano, <8> That in his face was full brown.  As he “roamed up and down,” the dreamer saw on the wall a tablet of brass inscribed with the opening lines of the Aeneid; while the whole story of Aeneas was told in the “portraitures” and gold work. About three hundred and fifty lines are devoted to the description; but they merely embody Virgil’s account of Aeneas’ adventures from the destruction of Troy to his arrival in Italy; and the only characteristic passage is the following reflection, suggested by the death of Dido for her perfidious but fate-compelled guest:  Lo! [SNIPPET] The death of Hector meanwhile enhanced the sorrow which he endured; but he found time to write often to Cressida, beseeching her to come again and hold her truth; till one day his false mistress, out of pity, wrote him again, in these terms:  “Cupide’s son, ensample of goodlihead,* *beauty, excellence O sword of knighthood, source of gentleness! How might a wight in torment and in dread, And healeless,* you send as yet gladness? * devoid of health I hearteless, I sick, I in distress? Since ye with me, nor I with you, may deal, You neither send I may nor heart nor heal."
1739,"But he finally recognized the girl Dr. Peccary had identified as Jenny Cheever. She had an attractive strawberry birthmark on her hip. She strolled back into the park accompanied by a young man. The two of them took possession of the bench where Jenny had been seated earlier. They sat well apart from each other, silently contemplating the other passers-by. Feeling that his knowledge of Jenny's name constituted a sort of introduction, Staghorn approached the couple. The man paid no attention to him but Jenny watched him curiously. [SNIPPET] Sit down and stop waving your arms. I'm going to see if we can get into the school."" Peccary sat down, seething. It had been a mistake to bring his Y Hormone to Staghorn."
1740,"A few minutes later the Ariel had rejoined her consorts. Her captain at once went on board the flagship to make his report and deliver up his prisoner to Natas, who looked sharply at him and said—  ""Professor, will you give me your word of honour to attempt no communication with the earth while it may be found necessary to detain you? If not, I shall be compelled to keep you in strict confinement till it is beyond your power to do so.""  ""Sir, I give you my word that I will not do so,"" said the Professor, who had now somewhat regained his composure. [SNIPPET] To increase this was merely a matter of increasing the power of the engine and the size of the floats and fans.  The room was a large one, for the house had been built for a better fate than letting in tenements, and it ran from back to front with a window at each end. Out of doors there was a strong breeze blowing, and as soon as Arnold was sure that his ship was able to hold its own in still air, he threw both the windows open and let the wind blow straight through the room. Then he drew the air-ship down, straightened the rudder, and set it against the breeze.  In almost agonised suspense he watched it rise from the floor, float motionless for a moment, and then slowly forge ahead in the teeth of the wind, gathering speed as it went. It was then that he had uttered that triumphant cry of ""Victory!"" All the long years of privation and hope deferred vanished in that one supreme moment of innocent and bloodless conquest, and he saw himself master of a kingdom as wide as the world itself.  He let the model fly the length of the room before he stopped the clockwork and cut off the motive power, allowing it to sink gently to the floor."
1741,"Would they let him die in this dark, dreary place? Had all his efforts merely led to a lonely, purposeless death? He wondered what they would do if he went out of his own accord; and finally decided that he must do it, even at the risk of offending them. Further inactivity he could not bear. Within five minutes he had formed a plan of action. It was night—the best time to work; for he must work undisturbed for a time. [SNIPPET] Then he climbed down from the couch, and crawled to the door. He reached up and grasped the knob. The young man had left it unlocked, and in a moment he was in the dim hallway. He crawled along, keeping close to the wall, until he came to the top of a stairway. He felt the cool night air on his face. Very slowly he lowered himself down the steps. He came to a wide door leading out into the open. Seated in a chair by this doorway was a man, whistling. The Martian waited patiently in the shadows until the man stood up, yawned, and strolled away."
1742,"An overwhelming emotion for the spheres! The sphere is frustrated—meets resistance—it disappears. In other words, it dies!"" From the city came screams and cries. The spheres had attacked at last. The men in the wooded field could see the darting balls sending their searing bolts down on the heads of hapless victims. The crashing roar of the slaughter sounded like distant thunderstorms. Streets were jammed with panic-stricken human beings, fleeing from the unknown menace which slashed with bolts of heat energy. [SNIPPET] Lock them together."" Taylor and Masters watched the circling spheres. Suddenly one darted down. From its pulsating body shot a flash of flame. A human scream rent the air. ""It's the darnedest thing I ever saw,"" Masters said with a shudder. "" Those fireballs squirt heat-electricity out at a guy and roast him!"" ""Yes,"" Taylor said with a nod, ""and that isn't all. Those spheres act as though they were alive."
1743,"It's my whole life. Knowing that my work on rockets is going to pay off only in the delivery of bombs, I don't want to go back to the 20th Century. I want to stay here."" Swarts said slowly, ""That's impossible."" ""Now, look, if you want me to cooperate...."" The big man made an impatient gesture. "" Not impossible because of me. Physically impossible. Impossible because of the way time travel works."" [SNIPPET] I am not going to tell you."" He had an accent, European, but otherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth to protest, but Swarts went on, ""However, you're free to do all the guessing you want."" Still there was no suggestion of a smile. ""Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have three meals a day, served in this room."
1744,"Big fellow like you must cost 'em twice as much to outfit for this job."" Sokolski grunted and struggled into the thick, radiation-resistant suit. "" Think how lucky you are, runt,"" he responded as he wriggled his right arm down the sleeve, ""that they've got those little servomechs in there to do the real dirty work. If it weren't for them, they'd have all the shrimps like you crawling down pipes and around dampers and generally playing filing cabinet for loose neutrons."" He shook himself. "" Thanks, Joe,"" he growled as Gaines helped him with a reluctant zipper. Gaines checked the big man's oxygen equipment and turned his back so that Sokolski could okay his own. "" You're set,"" said Sokolski, and they snapped on their helmets, big inverted lead buckets with narrow strips of shielded glass providing strictly minimal fields of view. Gaines plugged one end of the thickly insulated intercom cable into the socket beneath his armpit, then handed the other end to Sokolski, who followed suit. [SNIPPET] Think how lucky you are, runt,"" he responded as he wriggled his right arm down the sleeve, ""that they've got those little servomechs in there to do the real dirty work. If it weren't for them, they'd have all the shrimps like you crawling down pipes and around dampers and generally playing filing cabinet for loose neutrons."" He shook himself.

"" You're set,"" said Sokolski, and they snapped on their helmets, big inverted lead buckets with narrow strips of shielded glass providing strictly minimal fields of view."
1745,"""He's a dear old man,"" said Ann. "" I suppose he's very proud of you?""  ""I hope so.""  ""You must do tremendously well in America, so as not to disappoint him. What are you thinking of doing?"" [SNIPPET] It is one of my peculiarities that I never forget a face. You say that this young man pretends to have landed this morning from the Caronia? Well, I saw him myself more than a week ago in a Broadway cafe.""  ""You did?""  ""Talking to—Jerry Mitchell. I know Mitchell well by sight."""
1746,"Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going into the living room for a while. "" She'll be back for dessert, of course,"" he said, his laugh sounding forced. Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room. [SNIPPET] They'd had wonderful times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming. Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down! It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd also expected it."
1747,"But he held his grip, tightening it each second. There was a gasping, choking sound, a desperate writhe, another scratching of the invisible hands—and then came what Chris had feared, what he could not guard against since his eyes could not forewarn him. A heavy monkey-wrench appeared to rise of its own accord from the floor of the cockpit and come swinging at his head. He ducked at the last second. But it clipped him; his brain whirled dizzily. The next moment he slithered off the plane and fell to the ground, dragging the unseen Kashtanov with him. And as he pitched into the damp grass, the shock dislodged his grip. [SNIPPET] ""It iss I who am in command here, comrade Kashtanov. Remember that. I desire to speak to this man. There! No? No sign yet? Well! We will see if this helps those eyes of yours to open, my American!"""
1748,"The torment of his days took many forms in an alert subconscious too taut to relax. He had seen before him mountains too steep to cross—chasms too deep and wide to bridge. Often, when a great problem was solved, he would look back, nights later, to see the mountain or the chasm from the other side. Now his vision was different. No mountain before him, but a face—the stern craggy face of an obstacle in his path. Lee Gorman. The face was of clay—yet it lived. [SNIPPET] ""No major bugs, I think. It's coming along famously."" ""Good!"" For two hundred odd thousand it certainly should, Joshua felt. "" Let me know how you make out, Coving."" ""I will, Chief."
1749,"""Does it hurt to know that?"" Marcia looked into the smooth, strong face and said with genuine astonishment, ""Hurt? Oh, no! It's so—so big!"" [SNIPPET] And before she could answer him he added, ""I can't talk and work at the same time."" Feeling very much put-upon, Marcia waited silently until he was finished, and the bed hung ludicrously to the wall like a walking fly. She thanked him timidly, and he ignored it and went out. Miss Eagen returned."
1750,"T was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.  It was one January morning, very early—a pinching, frosty morning—the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.  Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captain’s return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. [SNIPPET] “There’s a breeze coming, Jim,” said Silver, who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.  I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching the manoeuvres of this last."
1751,"Somebody said they were humans, not pigs, and if the men on the rescue ship had never[108] seen a naked body before it was time they did. What was so wrong about the human body, anyhow? They made the muddy man go bathe himself in the river, and gave up trying to cover themselves. All at once the desire to cover themselves was a nasty kind of thinking, something to be ashamed of. Midmorning somebody got to wondering if the ten colonists who'd broken off from the main colony and moved across the ridge were all right. Soon as he reminded them, everybody began to laugh. What fools they'd all been. Showed you how a bit of trouble could keep a man from thinking straight. Here they'd been eating and sleeping like animals when, all the while, just across the ridge there'd be houses and beds, fires and clothes. [SNIPPET] It was a terrible thing for a man to realize he could never be an E. The scientists had to take it out on somebody. He understood. ""Hello, Dr. Mille,"" he said cordially in answer to a gruff grunt. "" This is Bill Hayes, of Sector Administration."" ""All right! All right!"""
1752,"For some time after this, K. found it impossible to exchange even just a few words with Miss Bürstner. He tried to reach her in many and various ways but she always found a way to avoid it. He would come straight home from the office, remain in her room without the light on, and sit on the sofa with nothing more to distract him than keeping watch on the empty hallway. If the maid went by and closed the door of the apparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again. He got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he might perhaps find Miss Bürstner alone as she went to the office. But none of these efforts brought any success. [SNIPPET] cried K.'s uncle when they were alone, as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself without looking at them to make himself more comfortable. K. said nothing, he knew what was coming, but, suddenly relieved from the effort of the work he had been doing, he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and looked out the window at the other side of the street. From where he sat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it, part of the empty walls of houses between two shop windows. "" You're staring out the window!"" called out his uncle, raising his arms, ""For God's sake, Josef, give me an answer!"
1753,"A net seemed to form in the air and close around him. There was a feel of innumerable hairy spiders running over him from head to foot. The net vanished. Something wrapped around his ankle and yanked. The lion growled. There was a loud clang and Dan's foot was free. [SNIPPET] Then they'll kill the sweepers and my bolt is shot."" ""Won't the men you've got here fire on those blue-caped fakes?"" ""Devisement,"" said the old man, shaking his head, ""you know better."" ""Are there any fire hoses? Will your men squirt water on the blue-caped ones?"" ""Yes,"" said the old man, leaning forward. "" They'll get shot. But yes, they will."
1754,"His gun stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. "" Don't move!"" he whispered harshly. "" Don't make a sound!"" I did exactly as I was told. [SNIPPET] I'm late!"" I shook my fist at the screen. "" Do you realize what you've done, disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!"""
1755,"""Good Gawd!"" he says, just like that: ""Good Gawd!"" That's all. ""Well,"" I says to him, ""who was right, the scientists or the artists?"" ""The artists!"" he sorta screeches. "" The artists were right all the time ... there is no reality! [SNIPPET] He musta been a pretty smart guy to know how to handle all those things, even if he was kinda dopey about other things. You know ... women and fishing and sports and drinking; he was lousy at everything except working those perspective problems. Personally, I couldn't see much sense to what he was doing. The guy could draw all right already, so I asked him what more did he want?"
1756,"Two paths were before him, but he tried to travel both. He later learned what we already know—that there can be no compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose. Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he could look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never live to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He left himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a man's dream. He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven knows how he escaped a checkup. [SNIPPET] He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was kind—but that doesn't matter now. Do you know why he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't want to die in the clean, cool air of Earth? It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the Universe, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother, brothers, the planets his children."
1757,"Scratches and mars, of course, easily to be overlaid again ere next day's dawn. But handsbreadths? Nay, sire."" ""In that case, try; and may Great Llosir guide your hand."" Tedric went forthwith to the castle and got a chunk of raw, massy gold. He took it to his shop and tried to work it into the thin, smooth film he could visualize so clearly. And tried—and tried—and tried. [SNIPPET] This would of course make another fork in time, but that fact did not bother Skandos One at all—now. As for Tedric; since the big, dumb lug couldn't be made to believe that he, Skandos One, was other than a god, he'd be a god—in spades! He'd build an image of flesh-like plastic exactly like the copper statue Tedric had made, and go back and announce himself publicly as the god Llosir. He'd come back—along Time-Track Three, of course—and do away with Skandos Three. There might have to be another interference, too, to get Tedric started along the right time-track."
1758,"Can you imagine what it is to be me and to look at people? A crowd at a ball game? A parade? Can you?"" ""Great God,"" the scientist breathed. ""When I see them for what they are, and when they exert the tremendous bulk of their united detestation and denial against me, when I feel rage rising inside myself—can you conceive—?"" ""That's enough. I don't want to try to think. Not of that. [SNIPPET] The room was a maze of test tubes, bottles, burners, retorts, instruments. During the meal he did not speak. Afterwards he resumed work. At twelve he prepared six tadpole eggs and put them to hatch. It would be his three hundred and sixty-first separate tadpole hatching. Then, one day in June, Danner crossed the campus with unusual haste. Birds were singing, a gentle wind eddied over the town from the slopes of the Rocky Mountains, flowers bloomed."
1759,"""It might be a solution,"" said the Chief. "" At least, a temporary one. I suppose we will have to find something else later on. But this will give us time to look for something."" So I became guard of the Treasure. With a badge. And nothing to do—unless you count watching the Key. The gates were kept locked, just as they were in the old days, but the large Key hung beside them. Of course, no one wanted to bother carrying it around. [SNIPPET] That's how I happened to get her in the first place. I'd always wanted one, but pets were forbidden. Busy people didn't have time for them. So I knew I was breaking the Law. But I figured that no one would ever find out. First I fixed a place for her, and made a brush screen, so that she couldn't be seen by anyone coming to the gates. Then, one night, I sneaked into the forest and got her. It wasn't so lonely after that. Now I had something to talk to."
1760,"Things connected with it, Rolf thought. Meaning me. He looked at her. She was as tall an Earther as he had yet seen, and probably suffered for it when there were no Spacers around. [SNIPPET] The policeman studied it. "" What business do you have with Quinton?"" ""Just tell me how to get there,"" Rolf said. "" I'm in a hurry."" The policeman backed up a step. """
1761,"Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:  —For England.  He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:  —home and beauty.  J. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.  A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. [SNIPPET] Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young. You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for titles. Have you read his F?"
1762,"The laboratory was a pinwheel going round and round. Through a sea of darkness he floated. A distant glow grew, expanded, became the crypt in the old Wiley mine. A moment he glimpsed the gleaming pillars, the pulsing machines, the startled birds, and then—Oh, it was incredible, impossible, but the dark, crumbling walls of the old shaft were around him; the globe in his hand no larger than a pea was lifting him towards life and safety.  He wanted to shout, to sing, but even as the pale stars fell athwart his upturned face, even as the cool mountain air smote his fevered brow, the dark earth erupted beneath his feet, a whirlwind of smoke and wind beat and buffeted him, and, in the midst of an overwhelming noise, consciousness was blotted out! [SNIPPET] THE first inkling the outside world had of the terrible tragedy that was happening at Oracle came over the phone to Tucson while John Redpath was still en route to that city.  ""Hello, hello! Is this the police station? Silby speaking. Silby, town constable at Oracle. For God's sake, send us help! We're being attacked. Yes, attacked from the air."
1763,"Too many times had he gone through this process of being aimed by astronomical calculation, and launched into the heavens, to be much stirred by the wonder of it. The journey to Z-40 in the Dart was no more disquieting than, a century and a half ago, before the United States had fused together into one vast city, a journey from Chicago to Florida would have been in one of the inefficient gasoline-driven vehicles of that day. All his thoughts were on his destination, and on a wonder as to what could be the nature of the thing that dwelt there. He had just come from the sanitarium where the man who'd bought Z-40 before him was recovering from nervous exhaustion. He'd gone there to try to get first hand information about the creature the executive at the Celestial Developments Company had talked so vaguely of. And the tale the convalescent had told him of the thing on the asteroid was as fantastic as it was sketchy. A tremendous, weirdly manlike creature looming in the dim night—a thing that seemed a part of the planetoid itself, fashioned from the very dirt and rock from which it had risen—a thing immune to the ray-pistol, that latest and deadliest of man-made small-arms—a thing that moved like a walking mountain and stared with terrible, stony eyes at its prey! [SNIPPET] ""Is its speed of revolution too great?"" ""Not at all. The days are nearly three hours long: annoying till you get used to it, but nothing like the inferior asteroids of the Mars Company where days and nights are less than ten minutes in duration."" ""Well, is it barren, then? No minerals of value? No vegetation?"""
1764,"I have your check written out in my pocket.”  “Afterward will do quite well.”  “Nine o’clock was the time specified, I believe?”  “I fancy so.” [SNIPPET] So passionate were his feelings that his body seemed to enlarge itself. At every frightful beat of sound, he quivered violently.  The entrance was doorless. Krag jumped onto the rocky platform and pulled Nightspore after him.  Once through the gateway, the light vanished. The rhythmical sound—blows totally ceased. Nightspore dropped his hands.... All was dark and quiet as an opened tomb."
1765,"It exists in the mind only. It and space are the only ideas inherently in our brains. They allow us to conduct ourselves among a vast collection of things-in-themselves which time does not affect."" ""But—"" ""Wait a moment. Granting that time is in the mind rather than in the outside world, what will happen if the time-sense is paralyzed? Won't the effect be similar to hypnosis whereby a man is reduced to a cataleptic state? The thought chain which usually passes ceaselessly through the brain is halted."" Seeing that the engineer still looked puzzled, June interposed: [SNIPPET] Sorry I could not come earlier."" Solinski advanced into the laboratory, giving the effect of driving the chemist before him. "" Trying to revive one of the sufferers, I see. May God aid you in this noble work."" He spread the tails of his long coat and sat down. As he talked his eyes flashed about the room, taking in every detail and at last fastening on June's fresh beauty like those of a vampire. "" Not,"" he boomed as he lighted a cigarette, ""not that I believe it possible—"""
1766,"“But perhaps you lack a sufficiency of land or souls?”  “Not at all. I and my brother own ten thousand desiatins 44 of land, and over a thousand souls.”  “Curious! I do not understand it. But perhaps the harvest has failed, or you have sickness about, and many of your male peasants have died of it?”  “On the contrary, everything is in splendid order, for my brother is the best of managers.”  “Then to find things wearisome!” [SNIPPET] And, so saying, he looked his interlocutor frankly and generously in the eyes.  Nevertheless Lienitsin’s resourcefulness and acumen in business matters failed to relieve his mind of a certain perplexity—and the less so since he had contrived to become caught in his own net. Yet, in general, he possessed neither a love for nor a talent for underhand dealings, and, had not fate and circumstances favoured Chichikov by causing Lienitsin’s wife to enter the room at that moment, things might have turned out very differently from what they did. Madame was a pale, thin, insignificant-looking young lady, but none the less a lady who wore her clothes a la St. Petersburg, and cultivated the society of persons who were unimpeachably comme il faut. Behind her, borne in a nurse’s arms, came the first fruits of the love of husband and wife. Adopting his most telling method of approach (the method accompanied with a sidelong inclination of the head and a sort of hop), Chichikov hastened to greet the lady from the metropolis, and then the baby. At first the latter started to bellow disapproval, but the words “Agoo, agoo, my pet!”"
1767,"Hyrst swore, shaking with sudden anger. "" Damn it, I won't be treated like a child. Not by you, by anyone. I want—"" ""You want the men who killed MacDonald,"" said Shearing. "" I know. [SNIPPET] That's right. Easy. Back to Elena and the kids. Lucky Elena, in the sun and the warm sweet air. Lucky kids. But I'm lucky too. I can go back to them soon. My nose itches."
1768,"Peter shook his head. "" No,"" he said. "" The source is too close."" ""Let's stroll up this street to the end and come back on the other side,"" said the dog. "" Quietly."" In a saunter they went, alert and poised. [SNIPPET] One of His Excellency's Peacekeepers presided over the exchange. Coldly he extracted a fiftyweight from the pile and folded it into the signed and completed wager-contract. For his own coffer he extracted a fiveweight and slipped it into his boot top. Peter Hawley and Buregarde passed on, went through the far door dragging their late adversary ignominiously by the heels."
1769,"You told me, when we got married, you always wanted to have a son—"" Frank pulled away. ""Sure I do,"" he said. "" A son. That's what I want. A real son. Not a freak. Not a damned little monster that has to go to the Clinic every month and take injections so it won't grow. [SNIPPET] The only trouble was, he hated the way they tasted. Harry wished he had time to eat his breakfasts in a restaurant. He could afford the price, but he couldn't afford to wait in line more than a half-hour or so. His office schedule at the agency started promptly at ten-thirty. And he didn't get out until three-thirty; it was a long, hard five-hour day. Sometimes he wished he worked in the New Philly area, where a four-hour day was the rule."
1770,"Of the garage, only the roof, islanded and bewildered, was visible, apparently resting[37] on a solid foundation of devilgrass. It sprawled kittenishly, its deceptive softness faintly suggesting fur; at once playful and destructive. My optimism of the night before was dashed; this voracious growth wasnt going to dwindle away of itself. It would have to be killed, rooted out. Now the Dinkman lawn wasnt continuous with its neighbors, but, until now, had been set off by chesthigh hedges. The day before these had contained and defined the growth, but, overwhelming them in the night, the grass had swept across and invaded the neat, civilized plots behind, blurring sharply cut edges, curiously investigating flowerbeds, barbarously strangling shapely bushes. But these werent the ravages which upset me; it was reasonable if not entirely comfortable to see shrubbery, plants and blossoms swallowed up. Work of men's hands they may be, but they bear the imprimatur of nature. The cement sidewalk, however, was pure artifice, stamped with the trademark of man. [SNIPPET] But I couldnt leave so cavalierly. Every leaf, stem, and blade of the cancerous grass held me in somewhat the same way Miss Francis' intense eyes did. It wasnt an aesthetic or morbid attraction—its basis was strictly practical. If it could have been controlled—if only the growth could be induced on a modified and proper scale—what a product!"
1771,"""Then one man came running back to me, and he said 'Get out of here. It's the devil's work. Get away from this place if you're a God-fearing man.' Then he turned and ran toward the subway with the rest. [SNIPPET] Then he followed with his pointer the route to the precinct jail where the victims were being held. ""Cannot our best researchers find a cure for this addiction?"" he asked in his husky voice. "" Cannot our best law-enforcement agencies find the real perpetrators of these crimes? The perpetrators are the fiends who import dope and create addicts to peddle it for them. These who are confined are the victims. If no way can be found to cure them, they must be confined again and again and again, for that addiction will force them to ever-increasing crime to satisfy it. ""If no way can be found to cure them, these are potential slaves for life—"" As he ended the station break came, and the camera shifted to the Witches, dancing on stage, crying their chant."
1772,"So why the big, high nose all at once?""  A bell clanged and the crash and roar of students dashing about echoed through the halls. Don shrugged carelessly.  ""Oh, I don't know. Can't even explain it to myself. Maybe I just don't like people pushing other people around. Maybe I don't like to be threatened. [SNIPPET] Right now, they're at peace with everybody, but they never let their guard down. We'll have a reception committee waiting for us."" He started striding up the steep path.  At the head of the chasm, five men waited for them. In their hands, they held sticks about two feet long. At the end of each stick was a thong, with a flexible leather pad which could hold a fair sized stone. Don bowed in the direction of one of the group.  ""I know you, Korendwar,"" he said."
1773,"Yes, the Chief can wait a few minutes longer for you to satisfy your vanity."" He summoned a blank-faced liveried servant and asked for a clean worker's suit for Dirrul. Then he took Dirrul to the wall tube and they shot noiselessly to an upper floor. As he left Dirrul at the door of a luxurious suite, the Vininese said, ""When you change your clothes, my friend, don't forget to take the disk out of your tunic. [SNIPPET] ""Not if they don't know, Eddie. That's where you come in. We've got to get Glenna and Hurd away from Agron. If there's no evidence of a crime there's no reason for an investigation."" ""But what can I do?"" ""Borrow one of the Air-command's surface jets for a while."" Paul Sorgel's plan was simple and efficient."
1774,"Before Langdon put down the strange statement of Gish “wandering about in the midst of omens” (misreading id-da-tim for it-lu-tim), he might have asked himself the question, what it could possibly mean. How can one walk among omens? Line 6. ka-ka-bu šá-ma-i must be taken as a compound term for “starry heaven.” The parallel passage in the Assyrian version (Tablet I, 5, 27) has the ideograph for star, with the plural sign as a variant. [SNIPPET] * * * * * Lions he o whereas Gilgamesh appears to be afraid of lions. On his long search for Utnapishtim he says:"
1775,"What will Blood say about this Dutchman?”  “Let him say what he pleases.” Levasseur laughed in the immensity of his relief.  “And what about the children of the Governor of Tortuga?”  “He must not know.”  “He'll come to know in the end.” [SNIPPET] For a moment the dragoon was speechless. The colour deepened in his face.  “You may find me great enough to hang you.”  “Faith, yes. Ye've the look and the manners of a hangman. But if you practise your trade on my patient here, you may be putting a rope round your own neck."
1776,"He expected to see some complicated mechanism, but there was little or nothing of the kind so far as he could make out in the darkness in this first hurried inspection.  Fastened to one wall was an apparatus which he judged was for the making of oxygen. He looked around for batteries, and for electric lights, but could see nothing of the kind. [Pg 33]  All this time Alan's mind had been busily trying to puzzle out the mystery of the girl's presence here alone. Evidently she came in the most friendly spirit; and thus, quite evidently, her mission, whatever it was, must be very different from that of the invaders who had landed almost simultaneously in Wyoming.  Whatever it was that had brought her—whatever her purpose—he realized it must be important. The girl, even now, seemed making no effort to show or explain anything to him, but continued plying him with questions that gave her the English words of everything about them that she could readily indicate. [SNIPPET] She was dressed especially for my coming, they told me afterward, exactly as she had been that morning when Alan found her. They wanted to confound me, and they succeeded.  I stood staring in amazement while Beth quietly introduced me. And Miela spread her wings, curtsied, and replied in a quaint, soft little voice: ""I am honored, sir."" Then she laughed prettily and, extending her hand, added: ""How do you do, Bob—my friend?""  When I had partially recovered from my astonishment Miela put on the big blue‑cloth cape she wore constantly to cover her wings. Then Alan and Beth plunged into an excited explanation of how he had found Miela, and how all this time she had remained in seclusion with them there studying their language. [Pg 54]  ""You never have seen such assiduous young people,"" Professor Newland put in. """
1777,"We have watched them grow on hot rocks, leaves, in the sand and best of all, filtered down a little into the moist earth. They grow incredibly fast with a little sun, so the chlorophyll is biologically justified in the life-cycle. This puzzled us at first, because the adult Tabby turns into a blood-sucking little brute. Deprived of any organic matter, our bottled specimens die in a short time, in or out of the sunlight, indicating the green stuff doesn't provide them with much if any nourishment after they are full-grown. [SNIPPET] The drums were on the beach. Now we were without lights, power and juice for our other radios. We kept alive the first few days by staying half drunk. Then Cleve's case of whiskey gave out and we began to get hungry. Sparks and Sellers set fire to one of our straw-ticking mattresses and used it as a torch to burn their way over to the supply tent about thirty feet away."
1778,"The rector asked which part of the parish we were to visit that morning. The estate map was produced, and when we had showed him our round, he put his finger on a particular spot. ' Don't forget,' he said, 'to ask John Hill about Martin's Close when you get there. I should like to hear what he tells you.' ' [SNIPPET] At another time he told me that he had been very uncomfortable both on the way to his hotel and during the night. I piece things together now in thinking it over. Then, not very long after, he was going over these programmes, putting them in order to have them bound up, and in this particular one (which by the way I had hardly glanced at), he found quite near the beginning a strip of paper with some very odd writing on it in red and black—most carefully done—it looked to me more like Runic letters than anything else. "" Why,"" he said, ""this must belong to my fat neighbour. It looks as if it might be worth returning to him; it may be a copy of something; evidently someone has taken trouble over it. How can I find his address?"""
1779,"""Sire,"" said the stranger, ""I come to ask of thee three boons. One I ask this day and on this day one year I shall come before you and crave your favor for the other two."" ""If the boon you ask, stranger, is aught we can grant, we shall do so cheerfully, for on this day we heed all prayers."" ""I ask very little, sire. This and no more do I wish--that you give me food and drink for one year and that on this day a year hence I shall make my other two prayers."" ""It is indeed little you ask. Food and drink we refuse none. It is here. Yet while your petition might well beseem a knave, thou seemeth of right good worship, a likely youth, too, none fairer, and we would fain your prayer had been for horse and armor. [SNIPPET] Luck may come my way. But I promise you this, my lady, I shall make no rash or fruitless attempt at rescue. Rash acts may well come after the rescue of your daughter, not before."" The Lady Jeanne agreed. So then immediately after the meal Walker, and the page Charles prepared the things they would need for the journey. ""I go forth to prepare the horses, young master. Will you see to these things here?"" So spoke Walker and when Charles agreed he hurried outdoors."
1780,"I gazed at Pending askance. ""Well, Pat? What now?"" ""How much do you weigh, Mr. Mallory?"" ""One sixty-five,"" I answered. ""You're sure of that?"" ""I'm not. But my bathroom scales appeared to be. This morning. [SNIPPET] After all, there are such things as basic principles. Weight is not a variable factor. And so far as I know, Congress hasn't repealed the Law of Gravity."" Pat sighed regretfully. ""You're always so hard to convince, Mr. Mallory,"" he complained. "" But—oh, well! Take this."""
1781,"Well, she can trust in me."" ""They say,"" the deacon hinted, ""that if one went to Tarog, and inquired at the proper place, there would be a reward."" The little old woman chilled him, she looked so deadly. ""Deacon Homms!"" she hissed. "" If you sell this poor little girl to Scar Balta, your hypocritical white eyes will never roll again, because I'll tear them out and feed them to the fish. Understand?"" Considerably shaken, the deacon said he understood. [SNIPPET] Sime asked enigmatically, concealing his dismay at the girl's ready reply. Here was inside information with a vengeance! ""Several shiploads of gray industrial diamonds from Venus have been seized by war vessels carrying the insignia of the Martian atmospheric guard."" Sime nodded. "" Go on!"" ""Curiously enough, these raids were so timed that they were witnessed by the news telecasters. All of the people on Earth were thus eye-witnesses, and feeling ran high. Am I right?"" ""Go on!""[8]"
1782,"She asked me to look you up while I was in New York. Have I come much too late?"" ""Oh, dear. Why, no. I suppose not. Come in, Mr.—Mr. Freeman."" In her parlor, she faced him apprehensively. [SNIPPET] Donnel, not taking his eyes from the crowd, said: ""Couple of years, sir. He was just a guy in the bodyguard pool."" ""Get me out of here,"" Orsino said. "" To the Syndic Building."" In the big black car, he could almost forget the horror; he could hope that time would erase it completely. It wasn't like polo."
1783,"He had even the manner of a gentleman. Mr. Fetherston’s tent was notably the largest in our camp, and the union jack floated over it on Sundays. And every Sunday all the officers and volunteers, that is to say, Mr. Fetherston, Mr. Berry and his assistant, Jack and myself, dined there in a sort of state; and it was Mr. Fetherston’s wont to have in one of the men to make the number even. And Gioro took his turn with us two or three times and was far the best conducted of those who were so invited. His ease of manner was perfect: he was as gentle and suave as an English nobleman; there was not a spark of self-assertion about him, and yet there was, or there seemed to be, a quiet consciousness of equality with his entertainers. He was also very courteous without being in the least bit cringing. He was glad [44] always to teach us anything that we didn’t know and that he knew, and he was grateful for being taught something in turn. Jack, for instance, took a great interest in the boomerang, and Gioro took much pains to teach him how to use it and how to make it. [SNIPPET] Jack and I wondered where our next meal was to come from, but Gioro did not seem at all anxious. We could not, however, get a word out of him about the matter except “plenty duck.” We made a start in the direction of west by north, or thereabouts, Gioro leading the way and we following blindly. He ran more carefully and rather more slowly, but there was still the same air of confidence about him. It was now very hot, but as we were well within [62] the tropics, and the sun at noon was now as nearly as we could reckon vertical, the only wonder was that it was not much hotter. We must have been still high up on the watershed, although descending it on the northern slope. There was plenty of grass everywhere, and a good deal of timber, not so much, however, as to obstruct our passage or impede our view. The country was undulating, but there were no steep hills to be traversed."
1784,"His words resounded like the crack of doom. "" So long!"" In the next four weeks Hugo knew the pangs of hunger frequently. He found odd jobs, but none of them lasted. Once he helped to remove a late snowstorm from the streets. He worked for five days on a subway excavation. [SNIPPET] On Monday Danner hastened home from his classes. During the night he had had a new idea. And a new idea was a rare thing after fourteen years of groping investigation. "" Alkaline radicals,"" he murmured as he crossed his lawn. He considered a group of ultra-microscopic bodies. He had no name for them."
1785,"Pendleton shivered once slightly. He started walking for his car and a block from it he found himself running. He got to Beth's place ahead of the approaching dusk. The downstairs door wasn't locked, but Beth's apartment door didn't open when he tried it. Pendleton grunted, slapping his pockets for something to pick the lock with. The door opened. Beth, in capris and a striped sweater, looked out at him, her head tilted slightly to one side. "" Did I hear applause? [SNIPPET] ""Just go away, Ben. Please, now."" She brushed by him and sat in a bucket chair, putting both bare feet down hard on the floor. Ben got himself up. "" You drunk?"" Beth brushed at her hair. "" I thought if you were sitting out here and I showed up in the bedroom, you'd think I came in the back way. Or that I was already in there and just hadn't heard you."""
1786,"He counted off the steps. No guards, no alarms, nothing to stop him. They depended on the conditioners to take care of everything. This time he would do it. [SNIPPET] Name's Charles Marquis."" The man blinked. "" I'm—I'm—No. 4901."" He looked down at his chest, repeated the number. His fingers shook a little as he touched his lips. Marquis said. "" What's this indoctrination?"" ""You—learn."
1787,"Just think, darling, no prying human eyes, no commands, no rules—only us for an hour or two. I know it isn't very long—"" He stared at the floor a minute. "" There's only one trouble. Elizabeth, you'll have to stay dismantled when I'm not here, it'll mean weeks of deactivation—"" [SNIPPET] It's got all the earmarks of a mech fraternization case."" ""Yeah. The boys in the lab were dead right, too. No two robots ever register the same on the meters. The contraband blips check perfectly. It's got to be this Frank Nineteen. Wait a minute, this proves it. Here's a suit of space fatigues with Nineteen's number stenciled inside."" Inspector Roberts took a notebook out of his pocket and consulted it. """
1788,"A guard was set that no one should relieve the miserable being. Felix's horror and indignation could not have been expressed, but he was totally helpless. His own condition of mind during this time was such as could not be well analysed. He did not himself understand whether his spirit had been broken, whether he was really degraded with the men with whom he lived, or why he remained with them, though there were moments when it dawned upon him that this education, rude as it was, was not without its value to him. He need not practise these evils, but it was well to know of their existence. Thus he remained, as it were, quiescent, and the days passed on. He really had not much to do, although the rest put their burdens upon him, for discipline was so lax, that the loosest attendance answered equally well with the most conscientious. The one thing all the men about him seemed to think of was the satisfying of their appetites; the one thing they rejoiced at was the fine dry weather, for, as his mates told him, the misery of camp life in rain was almost unendurable. [SNIPPET] If the citizen's wealth had made him many enemies (men whom he had befriended, and who hoped, if they could be see him executed, to escape the payment of their debts), on the other hand, it had made him as many friends, that is, interested friends, who trusted by doing him service to obtain advances. These latter had lost no time, for greed is quite as eager as hate, and carried the matter at once to the king. What they desired was that the case should be decided by the monarch himself, and not by his chancellor, or a judge appointed for the purpose. The judge would be nearly certain to condemn the citizen, and to confiscate whatever he could lay hands on. The king might pardon, and would be content with a part only, where his ministers would grasp all."
1789,"continued Swift, somewhat dazed. Who had suspected this animated reference library of such enterprise? ""I sent messenger number thirty-seven to them,"" he answered with a sigh, as if he were bored by such trifles. Then considering this topic exhausted, Mr. Ticks took out his notebook and looked absently out of the window; now and then he jotted down a few abstruse figures. He was engrossed in calculating the farm acreage adjacent to the railroad track between New York and Albany. When they drew nearer to the region of the catastrophe the papers gave more lurid accounts of it. These were purchased and read with avidity by those on board the flying express. Groups centred in the cars talked only of one thing. Reporters now joined the train at each prominent city. [SNIPPET] The Sunshine Hotel is too noisy, what with billiards and bowling and late dances; so I rode over here to look about, and an old lady with a pipe told me you lived here."" ""That was Aunt Betsey,"" said the girl decisively. "" But we never took boarders,"" with a stately drawing up of her head, ""why should she send you here?"" ""My dear,"" protested Mrs. McCorkle mildly, ""the Randolphs of Sunshine took boarders last winter; and I suppose we could get Aunt Betsey to cook."" She rose to carry away Ellesworth's glass, and beckoned to the girl to follow her. Evidently the two poor ladies whispered together in the hall, consulting upon the awful problem suddenly presented to their empty pockets and plethoric pride. They came out on the veranda again, and Mrs. McCorkle asked him point blank what his name was. Without perceptible hesitation he replied: ""Bigelow, madam."
1790,"A slight path of white began at his feet and expanded as it fell slightly, ramplike, over and into the city. The buildings were whiter than the gate of false dreams that Penelope sung of and the streets and avenues were blue, not gray. The people wore white and milled about in the streets below him. They shouted as one; their voices were not cries but songs and they sang his name. [SNIPPET] Jenkins flipped a switch and the room became bright with light. "" I thought you said this wasn't a thrill ride,"" Allenby said, looking at the helmetlike structure ominously hanging over the chair. ""It isn't,"" Jenkins said, smiling. "" Sit down."" He strapped the buyer into place in the chair. ""Hey, wait a minute,"" Allenby protested. """
1791,"Military equipment, I suppose."" ""Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it."" [SNIPPET] I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He said, ""Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any silly heroics, nothing will happen to you."""
1792,"she cried. "" That's it!"" ""Huh? What's what?"" ""You wanted to know how Pat could make money from his invention. [SNIPPET] There's one nice thing to be said about working for the bewhiskered old gentleman in the star-spangled stovepipe and striped britches: it's permanent. Once you get your name inscribed on the list of Civil Service employees it takes an act of Congress to blast it off again. And of course I don't have to remind you how long it takes that body of vote-happy windbags to act. Terrapins in treacle are greased lightning by comparison. But advancement is painfully slow in a department where discharges are unheard of and resignations rare. When I started clerking for this madhouse I was assistant to the assistant Chief Clerk's assistant."
1793,"This precept, though abominable in the sovereign and perfect friendship I speak of, is nevertheless very sound as to the practice of the ordinary and customary ones, and to which the saying that Aristotle had so frequent in his mouth, “O my friends, there is no friend,” may very fitly be applied. In this noble commerce, good offices, presents, and benefits, by which other friendships are supported and maintained, do not deserve so much as to be mentioned; and the reason is the concurrence of our wills; for, as the kindness I have for myself receives no increase, for anything I relieve myself withal in time of need (whatever the Stoics say), and as I do not find myself obliged to myself for any service I do myself: so the union of such friends, being truly perfect, deprives them of all idea of such duties, and makes them loathe and banish from their conversation these words of division and distinction, benefits, obligation, acknowledgment, entreaty, thanks, and the like. All things, wills, thoughts, opinions, goods, wives, children, honours, and lives, being in effect common betwixt them, and that absolute concurrence of affections being no other than one soul in two bodies (according to that very proper definition of Aristotle), they can neither lend nor give anything to one another. This is the reason why the lawgivers, to honour marriage with some resemblance of this divine alliance, interdict all gifts betwixt man and wife; inferring by that, that all should belong to each of them, and that they have nothing to divide or to give to each other.  If, in the friendship of which I speak, one could give to the other, the receiver of the benefit would be the man that obliged his friend; for each of them contending and above all things studying how to be useful to the other, he that administers the occasion is the liberal man, in giving his friend the satisfaction of doing that towards him which above all things he most desires. When the philosopher Diogenes wanted money, he used to say, that he redemanded it of his friends, not that he demanded it. And to let you see the practical working of this, I will here produce an ancient and singular example. Eudamidas, a Corinthian, had two friends, Charixenus a Sicyonian and Areteus a Corinthian; this man coming to die, being poor, and his two friends rich, he made his will after this manner. “ I bequeath to Areteus the maintenance of my mother, to support and provide for her in her old age; and to Charixenus I bequeath the care of marrying my daughter, and to give her as good a portion as he is able; and in case one of these chance to die, I hereby substitute the survivor in his place.” [SNIPPET] In giving myself so continual and so exact an account of myself, have I lost my time? For they who sometimes cursorily survey themselves only, do not so strictly examine themselves, nor penetrate so deep, as he who makes it his business, his study, and his employment, who intends a lasting record, with all his fidelity, and with all his force: The most delicious pleasures digested within, avoid leaving any trace of themselves, and avoid the sight not only of the people, but of any other person. How often has this work diverted me from troublesome thoughts? and all that are frivolous should be reputed so. Nature has presented us with a large faculty of entertaining ourselves alone; and often calls us to it, to teach us that we owe ourselves in part to society, but chiefly and mostly to ourselves. That I may habituate my fancy even to meditate in some method and to some end, and to keep it from losing itself and roving at random, ‘tis but to give to body and to record all the little thoughts that present themselves to it. I give ear to my whimsies, because I am to record them. It often falls out, that being displeased at some action that civility and reason will not permit me openly to reprove, I here disgorge myself, not without design of public instruction: and also these poetical lashes,"
1794,"""Here."" Strange how tranquil he sounded. A scarecrow of a figure arose almost at his right from a smoldering bush, a giant clothed in smoking rags. In the strange illumination of the search beams he seemed the wraith of a scarecrow. ""Thank God you're alive,"" Hilary croaked. "" The others...?"" Figures were staggering up from the holocaust about them. [SNIPPET] ""Yes,"" said Hilary lovingly as he unlocked the outer port side. A hasty glance around inside showed that nothing had been touched. Everything was orderly, methodical, just as he had left it. Grim and Wat examined with interest the banked controls, the polarization apparatus that set up repulsion waves and literally kicked the ship out into space away from the planet against which it had been set. ""Time enough to inspect,"" Hilary warned them. "" Never can tell when those damned Mercutians may spy on us.""  e set the polarization controls so that the mere pulling of a switch would send the flier careening off into space."
1795,"Ordnance controllers and gunners are a breed apart, especially when they're taking care of their own, and even when working conditions are tight. They normally do most of their own maintenance. The guns are modern, and there's a good supply of ready-to-install chargers. Ship commanders exercise their gun crews frequently, and many have been on the raids, so they have ops experience that the UIPS Space Force lacks. As far as armaments go, this fleet will be a powerful adversary in any confrontation."" [SNIPPET] The computer adjusted to focus on a magnified Plutonian sector. The Uranus and Neptune orbits, although contained within the tank displays, were cut out by the compression. The Slingshot Construction Site rode the rim. ""Updating, the latest reports of military construction, commitments and political realignments among the Outer Nations are ominous,"" Allen said. "" They're pledging themselves to each other through mutual assistance pacts and are building military spacecraft, weapons and support systems to back up their agreements."" Pointing thoughtfully with his right forefinger at his left palm, Allen updated the military assets of each opposing nation, and correlated its potential capabilities to economic resources over the coming decades and centuries until Slingshot reduced the solar system's deficits. He wove into his analysis the effects of orbital dynamics on normal and spunnel transit times from each Inner and Outer Region point-of-origin to the Slingshot work sites."
1796,"But Rynason was already starting his run across the field. When he had some speed he kicked in the rocket booster and fought the little flyer skyward. When he had caught the air he banked southward and fed the motors all he had. He didn’t look around for the others; he was setting his own pace. The mountain range was ten miles to the south; they should be able to make it in five or six minutes, he figured. Below him on the dry Flat he saw the pale shadow of his flyer skimming across the dust. The drone of the motors filled the compartment. [SNIPPET] They were quiet, slow-moving creatures. Or had they degenerated physically through the centuries? Still smelling the sweat of battle, he found Tebron’s mind again. There was still fighting in the city, but it was far away now; he heard it with the back of his mind as he mounted the steps of the Temple. Those were mop-up operations, clearing the streets of the last of the priest-king forces; he was not needed there. He had, to all intents, controlled the city since the night before, and had slept in the palace itself. Now it was time for the Temple."
1797,"The answer was with him. She loved him as he was, Merle Duggan—not as a new personality in her husband's body. Artificial amnesia automatically dissolves all marriage partnerships. She had not wanted that. Instead she had three years of hell. Striking out at emptiness, his fists contacting soft flesh, and the pained cry, swiftly suppressed, of Janith. His voice, cursing and high-pitched, as he fought the straps that now were restraining his sightless body. The bite of a needle and gradual dissolution of feeling. Memory was coming reluctantly back to Duggan. [SNIPPET] Duggan started forward, remembered the ugly expoder muzzles and backed away. ""Was her name Janith?"" he demanded. ""Radio report didn't say. Contact them, Joe,"" he told one of the other faceless men. ""Couldn't be you hired these two to kill her and pretend the robbery?"""
1798,"But thou, immortal, surely knowest all. This I well know, and feel; From these eternal rounds, And from my being frail, Others, perchance, may pleasure, profit gain; To me life is but pain.  My flock, now resting there, how happy thou, That knowest not, I think, thy misery! O how I envy thee! Not only that from suffering Thou seemingly art free; That every trouble, every loss, Each sudden fear, thou canst so soon forget; But more because thou sufferest No weariness of mind. When in the shade, upon the grass reclined, Thou seemest happy and content, And great part of the year by thee In sweet release from care is spent. But when I sit upon the grass And in the friendly shade, upon my mind A weight I feel, a sense of weariness, That, as I sit, doth still increase And rob me of all rest and peace. And yet I wish for nought, And have, till now, no reason to complain. [SNIPPET] Nor did I think Thou e’er couldst know it more; and oh, that thought My sorrow rendered more disconsolate! But art thou now again to leave me? I fear so. Say, what hath befallen thee? Art thou the same? What preys upon thee thus?” “ Oblivion weighs upon thy thoughts, and sleep Envelops them,” she answered; “I am dead, And many months have passed, since last we met.”"
1799,"""John,"" said the great fellow, laughing heartily; ""and they call me little because I'm so big. What do you think of that?"" ""I think it's very stupid,"" said the boy. "" I thought you must be Robin Hood."" ""Then you thought wrong. But if you thought that this one was you would be right. Here he comes."" The boy looked in wonder at a tall man who looked short beside Little John, as he came up in coat of green with brown belt, a sword by his side, quiver of arrows hung on his back, and longbow in his hand. ""What woodland bird have you got here, John?"" [SNIPPET] ""Oh! that makes all the difference. How big was he—big as this man?"" Young Robin glanced at the giant who had caught him, and shook his head. ""No,"" he said; ""not half, so big as he is. But he was stronger than I am."" ""So I suppose. Well, bring him along. Little John, and let's see if the women can find him some clothes and a cap."
1800,"This had to be the warhead. He checked it anyway. Temperature was minus 40° F. A smile flickered on his lips as he caught the significance of the temperature. He hoped the launching crew had gotten their fingers frozen off while they were going through the countdown. The object showed no anomalous radar behavior. Beyond doubt, it was the warhead. [SNIPPET] The outer two were televised images of the radar screens at the stations a hundred miles on either side of him, part of a chain of stations extending from Alaska to Greenland. In the room, behind him, and facing sets of screens similar to his, sat his assistants. They located the incoming objects on the screen and set automatic computers to determining velocity, trajectory, and probable impact point. This information appeared as coded symbols beside the tracks on the center screen of the Launch Control Officer, as well as all duplicate screens. The Launch Control Officer, and he alone, had the responsibility to determine whether the parameters for a given track were compatible with an invading Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, or whether the track represented something harmless. If he failed to launch an interceptor at a track that turned out to be hostile, it meant the death of an American city. However, if he made a habit of launching interceptors at false targets, he would soon run out of interceptors. And only under the pressure of actual war would the incredible cost of shipping in more interceptors during the winter be paid without a second thought. Normally, no more could be shipped in until spring."
1801,"Now take these bits and weave them horizontally into a thick mass. Then add, vertically, more of the wires, breaking the pattern occasionally and putting in more in odd places, just to be sure there are no[72] logical fracturepoints. Cover this involved web—not forgetting it has three dimensions despite my instructions treating it as a plane—with earth, eight, ten, or twelve inches deep. Then try to blow it up with dynamite or trinitrotoluene and see if you havent—in a much lesser degree—duplicated and accounted for the situation in hand."" Everything now seemed unusually and, perhaps because of the contrast, unreasonably quiet. Downstairs the radio, which had been monotonously soothing a presumptive audience of unsatisfied housewives with languid ballads, raised its pitch several tones as though for the first time it had become interested in what it purveyed. ""... Yes, unseen friends, God is preparing His vengeance for wickedness and sin, even as you are listening. You have been warned many times of the wrath to come, but I say to you, the wrath is at hand. [SNIPPET] 34. When the grass was thought to be invincible, Miss Francis, as the discoverer of the compound which started it on its course, was the recipient of a universal if grudging respect. Those whom the grass had made homeless hated her and would have overcome their natural feeling of protection toward a woman sufficiently to lynch her if they could. Men like Senator Jones instinctively disliked her; others, like Dr Johnson, detested her, but no one thought of her lightly, even when they glibly coupled the word nut with her name. When it was found the saltband worked Miss Francis immediately became the butt of all the ridicule and contumely which could be heaped upon her head. What could you expect of a woman who meddled with things outside her province?"
1802,"There is the ticket on the file. J. Eldred, 11.3.34. Title of work: T-a-l-m—well, there, you can make what you like of it—not a novel, I should 'azard the guess. And here is Mr Heldred's note applying for the book in question, which I see he terms it a track.' 'Thanks, thanks: but the address? There's none on the note.' 'Ah, indeed; well, now … stay now, Mr Garrett, I 'ave it. Why, that note come inside of the parcel, which was directed very thoughtful to save all trouble, ready to be sent back with the book inside; and if I have made any mistake in this 'ole transaction, it lays just in the one point that I neglected to enter the address in my little book here what I keep. [SNIPPET] In thinking it over, one of the oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever. Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable to speak about it. 'That is my story,' said the narrator. ' The only approach to a ghost story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach to such a thing.'  * * * * * The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland. One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. '"
1803,"They were colorless but burning with internal fires. He rubbed one of them hard across the ruby he still carried and there was a gritting sound as it cut a deep scratch in the ruby. ""I'll be damned,"" he said aloud. There was only one stone hard enough to cut a ruby—the diamond. [SNIPPET] Barber, trying to develop a strain of herbs that would grow in the lower elevation of the caves, was killed by a unicorn as he worked in his test plot below the caves. Craig went limping out one spring day on the eighth year to look at a new mineral a hunter had found a mile from the caves. A sudden cold rain blew up, chilling him before he could return, and he died of Hell Fever the same day. Schroeder was killed by prowlers the same year, dying with his back to a tree and a bloody knife in his hand. It was the way he would have wanted to go—once he had said to Lake: ""When my times comes I would rather it be against the prowlers. They fight hard and kill quick and then they're through with you."
1804,"When can we try it in the pilot plant."" ""Well, that's where the problem comes in, Carl. I have to leave for the West Coast tomorrow, and I'll be gone for six months. There's nobody else around here to take it through the pilot plant. [SNIPPET] Finally he said, ""Carl, we have quite a problem here, and we don't know what to do about it. Here's the situation."" I swallowed, and took out my notebook and pencil, and laid my pocket slide rule in front of me. I always put the slide rule out where the inventor can see it to remind him that he is talking to another technical man, not just a lawyer. This helps make him stick to the facts. I didn't need the rule with Callahan, but habit is hard to break."
1805,"You should ha' given 'em to me at first, and then I shouldn't have hurt yer. Come on; I'll show yer now where yer can get something to eat."" In his anger and shame Robin felt that he wanted no food now, only to go and hide himself away among the trees; but his enemy's next words had their effect. ""You didn't want this here,"" he said. "" [SNIPPET] ""Quack, quack, quack, quack!"" came from out of the reeds, and a brown duck came sailing out, followed by ten little yellow balls of down with flat beaks, swimming like their mother, but in a hurried pop-and-go-one fashion, in and out, and round and round, and seeming to go through country dances on the water in chase of water beetles and running spiders or flies, while the duck kept on uttering a warning quack, and the drake, who, first with one eye and then with the other, kept a sharp look up in the sky for falcons and hawks, now and then muttered out a satisfied ""Wirk—wirk—wirk!"" Robin was Just thinking how beautiful it all was, when the danger for which the drake was watching in the sky suddenly came from the water beneath. One of the downy yellow dabs had swum two yards away from the others and his mother, after a daddy long-legs which had flown down on to the surface of the water, and had opened its little flat beak to seize it, when there was a whirl in the water, a rush and splash, and two great jaws armed with sharp teeth closed over the duckling, which was visible one moment, gone the next, and Robin drew an arrow out to fit to his bow-string. But he was too late to send it whizzing at the great pike, which had given a whisk with its tail and gone off to some lair in the reeds to peacefully swallow the young duck, while the rest followed their quacking father and mother back to the shelter of the reeds, rushes, and sedge, where the moor-hen and her brood were already safe, while, startled by the alarm, the heron bent down as it spread its great gray wing's, sprang up, gave a few flaps and flops, and began to sail round above the pool till it grew peaceful again, when, stretching out its legs, the heron dropped back into the water, stood motionless gazing down with meditative eyes as if quite satisfied that no fish would touch it, and then, flick! It had taken place so rapidly that Robin hardly saw the movement, but certainly the heron's beak was darted in amongst the bottoms of the reeds where they grew out of the water, and directly afterwards the bird straightened itself again, to stand up with a kicking green frog in its scissor-shaped beak. Then there was a jerk or two, which altered the frog's position, and the beak from being only a little way open was shut quite close, and a knob appeared in the heron's long neck, went slowly lower and lower, and then disappeared altogether."
1806,"""And this,"" I said, ""must be their harvest time. You notice that this asteroid, being several million miles nearer to the sun than Mars is, must have an appreciably shorter period of revolution. When it is in conjunction with Mars, or nearly so, as it is at present, the distance between the two is not very great, whereas when it is in the opposite part of its orbit they are separated by an enormous gap in space and the sun is between them. ""Manifestly in the latter case it would be perilous if not entirely impossible for the Martians to visit the golden asteroid, but when it is near Mars, as it is at present, and as it must be periodically for several years at a time, then is their opportunity. ""With their projectile cars sent forth with the aid of the mysterious explosives which they possess, it is easy for them under such circumstances, to make visits to the asteroid. [SNIPPET] Wires had been run all over the city, and hundreds of improved telephonic receivers provided, so that everyone could hear. Even those who were unable to visit Washington, people living in Baltimore, New York, Boston, and as far away as New Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago, had also listened to the proceedings with the aid of these receivers. Upon the whole, probably not less than 50,000,000 people had heard the deliberations of the great congress of the nations. The telegraph and the cable had sent the news across the oceans to all the capitols of the earth. The exultation was so great that the people seemed mad with joy. The promised exhibition of the electrical ship took place the next day. Enormous multitudes witnessed the experiment, and there was a struggle for places in the car. Even Queen Victoria, accompanied by the Prince of Wales, ventured to take a ride in it, and they enjoyed it so much that Mr. Edison prolonged the journey as far as Boston and the Bunker Hill monument. Most of the other monarchs also took a high ride, but when the turn of the Emperor of China came he repeated a fable which he said had come down from the time of Confucius:"
1807,"You don't understand about last night. It wasn't the way that lousy columnist said—"" She stopped in her tracks. ""I wouldn't have minded so much if you'd gotten me drunk. But to use me, just to get a story—"" ""But I'm a reporter, damn it. [SNIPPET] That's the big point. It's a spaceship."" ""A what?"" ""A spaceship,"" Greta said coolly, sipping lemonade. """
1808,"Oh, Frank, the main thing is we're together again!"" The big servo checked the chronometer that was sunk into his left wrist and a couple of wrinkles creased across his neoprene forehead. ""Elizabeth,"" he said, ""I'm due on Hidalgo in 36 hours. If I'm late the mining engineer might suspect. In twenty minutes I'll have to start dis—"" [SNIPPET] he hummed anxiously. "" Is she all right? I have to know."" Frank stood perfectly still when I told him about Elizabeth's self-deactivation; then a pitiful shudder went through him and he covered his face with his big Neoprene hands. ""I was afraid of that,"" he said barely audibly. "" Where—you haven't—?"" ""No,"" I said. "" She's where you always kept her."" With that the big servo-pilot took off for 22A like a berserk robot and we were right behind him."
1809,"When you showed up in the spaceways, it was decreed that you had to be stopped at once. There was even serious discussion of destroying Earth out of hand, while it is still possible. ""Your silly little planet was carefully examined at long range in a routine investigation just about fifty thousand years ago. There were at that time three different but similar racial strains of pulpy bipeds, numbering a total of perhaps a hundred thousand individuals. They showed many signs of an ability to reason, but a complete lack of civilization. While these creatures could by no means be classed among the intelligent races, there was a general expectation, which we reported to the Sunda, that they would some day come to be numbered among the Servants of the Emperor. [SNIPPET] ""It was the thinking of a genius,"" murmured Ggaran. ""All right, then, genius, here I am,"" said Crownwall. "" So what's the pitch?"" ""Ggaran, you explain it to the Earthling,"" said His Effulgence. Ggaran bowed. "" The crustaceans on Sunda—the lobsterlike creatures that rule the Galaxy—are usurpers."
1810,"Surely a man so resolute must make enough money to support a wife. ""Yes,"" Sally breathed, snuggling close to him. "" Oh, yes!"" She paused a moment, then said, ""You may kiss me now if you wish, my darling."" He straightened and frowned a little, and looked away quickly. "" [SNIPPET] And it filled her with terror to see that Tommy's mood could change as abruptly and terrifyingly cold . Tommy, her son. Tommy, no longer boisterous and eager, but sitting in a corner with his legs drawn up, a faraway look in his eyes. Tommy seeming to look right through her, into space. Tommy and Jim exchanging silent understanding glances."
1811,"That couldn't be the answer. Citric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl discovered a week later. The Steel-Blue who had captured him in the power room of the service station came in to examine him. ""You're still holding out, I see,"" he observed after poking Jon in every sensitive part of his body. ""I'll suggest to No. 1 that we increase the power of the—ah—hemlock. How do you feel?"" Between the rich oxygen and the dizziness of hunger, Jon was a bit delirious. But he answered honestly enough: ""My guts feel as if they're chewing each other up. [SNIPPET] Lying there helplessly, Jon was remembering an old fairy tale he'd read as a kid. Something about a fellow named Socrates who was given a cup of hemlock to drink. It was the finis for Socrates. But the old hero had been nonchalant and calm about the whole thing. With a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious unto death, relaxed and said, ""All right, bub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll take it like a man."""
1812,"""Don't crawl, Arena,"" I said. I went up the short stair, came out onto a block-square pad. Arena was right about the rotos. Eight of them. I picked the four-place Cad, and got Stenn tied in. He was coming to, muttering. He was still fighting Arena, he thought. ""... I'll hold ... you ... get out...."" [SNIPPET] He fished my wallet out and put it in his pocket without looking at it. I heard the other man say something to Stenn, and then the sound of a blow. I turned my head slowly, so as not to excite my watchdog. Stenn was picking himself up. He started going through his pockets, showing everything to the man with the gun, then dropping it on the ground."
1813,"Not much yet. It's only just started back, but it's begun. The radiation is down. Plants are growing again."" The power of suggestion. And, of course, the heightened sensitivity caused by the double threat of a man beside me carrying a gun that yawning aching expanse of nothing beyond the window. I nearly fancied that I did see faint specks of green. [SNIPPET] She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had happened—I'd broken a shoe lace—she refused to speak to me for four days. And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from ruining my mood."
1814,"From looks of things, either this outfit has been traveling far or else several villages have combined forces. If it's the last, then I'm plenty worried."" ""So what do we do? Go back and yell for reinforcements?"" [SNIPPET] ""Now then, your names once more, please?"" He fixed them firmly in his mind as each boy introduced himself in turn. "" Ah, yes. And I, of course, am General Reilly, Commandant of the Academy."" ""Sir?"" ""Yes, Mr. Kaslov?"" ""Would that be the General Reilly? Of the Deneb Crisis?"" ""I see my fame has preceded me, gentlemen."
1815,"He had to make himself a new robe while the cab meter ticked and Kate jittered. But once started, the drive between balconied buildings and intervening plazas went fast enough. Bozzy wasn't over half an hour late in reaching Mr. Kojac's apartment building. The old man waited in the street, looking spare, spruce, and impatient. ""I do wish,"" he said, easing himself into the cab, ""that you had a less anti-social attitude. Now you'll have to claim I delayed you."" ""I'm sorry, sir,"" Bozzy mumbled. "" [SNIPPET] ""An excuse, Boswell! Whether conscious or subconscious, nothing more than an excuse! Distaste for today's ceremonial is smeared over your face like so much bread-and-jelly."" Unconsciously, Bozzy wiped his cheeks. Mr. Kojac laughed. """
1816,"And there are the lava-flows, too, and the choking smoke—"" ""Well, we can't climb these cliffs. Honath's quite right,"" Alaskon said. "" And we can't climb the Basalt Steppes, either—there's nothing to eat along them, let alone any water or cover. I don't see what else we can do but try to get up into the foothills."" ""Can't we stay here?"" [SNIPPET] For a moment nobody moved. Then Honath crept forward. It had been Seth, as Honath had realized the moment the figurine had burst through the branches far above. But it had not been the fall that had killed him. He had been run through by at least a dozen needles—some of them, beyond doubt, tools from his own shop, their points edged hair-fine by his own precious strops of leatherwood-bark. There would be no reprieve from above. The sentence was one thousand days. This burst and broken huddle of fur was the only alternative. And the first day had barely begun."
1817,"Gaines moaned, ""It gets damned hot inside these suits."" They had reached the end of the trap, and Sokolski folded a thick mittened hand around one handle on the door to the Hot Room. "" Not half so hot as it gets outside it, sweetheart, where we're going."" He jerked on the handle and Gaines seized the second handle and added his own strength. The huge door slid unwillingly back. The silent sound of the Hot Room surged out over them—the breathless whisper of chained power struggling to burst its chains. Sokolski checked his neutron tab and his gamma reader and they stepped over the threshold. [SNIPPET] ""Oh?"" Sokolski came over beside him and peered through the violet haze of his viewing glass. "" He's an old timer."" Gaines slid an instrument back into the pouch of his suit, and patted the robot's rump. "" Yep, I'd say that capacitor was good for about another thirty-six hours. It's really overloading."" He straightened. "" You done with the board?"" ""Yeah."
1818,"The few moments' delay there was enough to make all the difference. Thinking and acting wisely, even without a leader, the Martian space-hands met the emergency. They had withdrawn from the open hatchway, but could reach the mechanism that closed it. Parr was too late to jump in after them. Then one of them fired the undamaged rear tubes. Swish! Whang! The ship took off so abruptly that Parr barely dodged aside in time, dragging along with him the new Terrestrial whose shoulder he clutched, and also the surprised Martian skipper. The rocket blasts, dragging fiery fingers across the plain, struck down Haldocott and Jeffords, and bowled over two of the laggards with Shanklin's belated contingent. [SNIPPET] Make one more in camp. Come."" Among tall trees, thickly grown, lay a throng of sleepers. Parr's companion led him there, and made an awkward gesture. ""You lie down."
1819,"Gentlemen, what shall we do concerning—"" ""Yes, gentlemen, that is just what I want to know."" Three heads pivoted. Novell Lesquallan, sole owner of Lesquallan Ltd., stood in the doorway. [SNIPPET] Captain Verbold hesitated. "" It's something I've been expecting. The crew has stated that they will leave the ship at Mars."" Captain Verbold's next sentence was pronounced word by word in code. "" I even have private information that there is a plot to take over the ship and blast directly to Earth, where the crew feel their case can be more justly presented."" ""What are they squawking about?"" ""Everything."
1820,"Polly, will you marry me tomorrow?""  ""No, certainly not, sir.""  ""Then will you marry me on Monday?""  ""Do you truly, truly want me to?""  ""Truly, truly.""  ""Then, yes,"" and the dear girl again came blushing into my arms.  While we were thus the door opened, and in came her parents who were staying at a neighbouring hotel while inquiries were made as to my mysterious absence. Not unnaturally my appearance went a long way to confirm suspicions such as Mrs. Brown had confessed to, and, after they had given me cold salutations, Polly's mother, fixing gold glasses on the bridge of her nose and eyeing me haughtily therefrom, observed, [SNIPPET] there is an eddy still unsearched, and I will show you how they lie.""  It was very fascinating, and I and that old man set to work amongst the gravels, and, to be brief, in half an hour found enough glittering stuff to set up a Fifth Avenue jeweller's shop. But to tell the truth, now that I had breakfasted, and felt manhood in my veins again, I was eager to be off, and out of the close, death-tainted atmosphere of that valley. Consequently I presently stood up and said—  ""Look here, old man, this is fine sport no doubt, but just at present I have a big job on hand—one which will not wait, and I must be going. See, luck and young eyes have favoured me; here is twice as much gold and stones as you have got together—it is all yours without a question if you will show me the way out of this den and afterwards put me on the road to your big city, for thither I am bound with an errand to your king, Ar-hap.""  The sight of my gems, backed, perhaps, with the mention of Ar-hap's name, appealed to the old fellow; and after a grunt or two about ""losing a tide"" just when spoil was so abundant, he accepted the bargain, shouldered his belongings, and led me towards the far corner of the beach.  It looked as if we were walking right against the towering ice wall, but when we were within a yard or two of it a narrow cleft, only eighteen inches wide, and wonderfully masked by an ice column, showed to the left, and into this we squeezed ourselves, the entrance by which we had come appearing to close up instantly we had gone a pace or two, so perfectly did the ice walls match each other."
1821,"Soon he must eat—and there was no food. He crawled into the bushes; and lay down, lonely and sick. He would stay here. This was failure—and the end. But he was not sorry for having tried. [SNIPPET] He felt increasingly drowsy. His sleep period would come soon, he knew. He could not stave it off much longer. And when he had slept, he must eat. He came to level ground. Ahead was an opening in the trees, where a wide ledge of stone was revealed."
1822,"Our third stop was the Porandians. They tried to kill us—called us 'Devil spawn from the stars.' You're thinking of the fourth stop; the Balanites."" Bates shrugged. "" It's kind of hard to keep them all straight. [SNIPPET] ""Thanks,"" laughed the young man. "" But there was nothing to it. We just asked the Oracle and he told us what we had to do to make them."" ""May we meet your—Oracle?"" ""Oh, sure, if you want to. But later on. Now it's time for a party. Why don't you take off those clumsy suits and come along?"" ""We don't dare remove our spacesuits."
1823,"He observed, that the exhalations arising from such a nuisance, could not but be prejudicial to the weak lungs of many consumptive patients, who came to drink the water. The Doctor overhearing this remark, made up to him, and assured him he was mistaken. He said, people in general were so misled by vulgar prejudices that philosophy was hardly sufficient to undeceive them. Then humming thrice, he assumed a most ridiculous solemnity of aspect, and entered into a learned investigation of the nature of stink. He observed, that stink, or stench, meant no more than a strong impression on the olfactory nerves; and might be applied to substances of the most opposite qualities; that in the Dutch language, stinken signifies the most agreeable perfume, as well as the most fetid odour, as appears in Van Vloudel’s translation of Horace, in that beautiful ode, Quis multa gracilis, &c.—The words fiquidis perfusus odoribus, he translates van civet & moschata gestinken: that individuals differed toto coelo in their opinion of smells, which, indeed, was altogether as arbitrary as the opinion of beauty; that the French were pleased with the putrid effluvia of animal food; and so were the Hottentots in Africa, and the Savages in Greenland; and that the Negroes on the coast of Senegal would not touch fish till it was rotten; strong presumptions in favour of what is generally called stink, as those nations are in a state of nature, undebauched by luxury, unseduced by whim and caprice: that he had reason to believe the stercoraceous flavour, condemned by prejudice as a stink, was, in fact, most agreeable to the organs of smelling; for, that every person who pretended to nauseate the smell of another’s excretions, snuffed up his own with particular complacency; for the truth of which he appealed to all the ladies and gentlemen then present: he said, the inhabitants of Madrid and Edinburgh found particular satisfaction in breathing their own atmosphere, which was always impregnated with stercoraceous effluvia: that the learned Dr B—, in his treatise on the Four Digestions, explains in what manner the volatile effluvia from the intestines stimulate and promote the operations of the animal economy: he affirmed, the last Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Medicis family, who refined upon sensuality with the spirit of a philosopher, was so delighted with that odour, that he caused the essence of ordure to be extracted, and used it as the most delicious perfume: that he himself (the doctor) when he happened to be low-spirited, or fatigued with business, found immediate relief and uncommon satisfaction from hanging over the stale contents of a close-stool, while his servant stirred it about under his nose; nor was this effect to be wondered at, when we consider that this substance abounds with the self-same volatile salts that are so greedily smelled to by the most delicate invalids, after they have been extracted and sublimed by the chemists.—By this time the company began to hold their noses; but the doctor, without taking the least notice of this signal, proceeded to shew, that many fetid substances were not only agreeable but salutary; such as assa foetida, and other medicinal gums, resins, roots, and vegetables, over and above burnt feathers, tan-pits, candle-snuffs, &c. In short, he used many learned arguments to persuade his audience out of their senses; and from stench made a transition to filth, which he affirmed was also a mistaken idea, in as much as objects so called, were no other than certain modifications of matter, consisting of the same principles that enter into the composition of all created essences, whatever they may be: that in the filthiest production of nature, a philosopher considered nothing but the earth, water, salt and air, of which it was compounded; that, for his own part, he had no more objections to drinking the dirtiest ditch-water, than he had to a glass of water from the Hot Well, provided he was assured there was nothing poisonous in the concrete. [SNIPPET] Mrs Tabby broke forth again in praise of his moderation, and declared that Scotland was the soil which produced every virtue under heaven. When Lismahago took his leave for the night, she asked her brother if the captain was not the prettiest gentleman he had ever seen; and whether there was not something wonderfully engaging in his aspect?—Mr Bramble having eyed her sometime in silence, ‘Sister (said he), the lieutenant is, for aught I know, an honest man and a good officer—he has a considerable share of understanding, and a title to more encouragement than he seems to have met with in life; but I cannot, with a safe conscience, affirm, that he is the prettiest gentleman I ever saw; neither can I descern any engaging charm in his countenance, which, I vow to God, is, on the contrary, very hard-favoured and forbidding.’  I have endeavoured to ingratiate myself with this North-Briton, who is really a curiosity; but he has been very shy of my conversation ever since I laughed at his asserting that the English tongue was spoke with more propriety at Edinburgh than at London. Looking at me with a double squeeze of souring in his aspect, ‘If the old definition be true (said he), that risibility is the distinguishing characteristic of a rational creature, the English are the most distinguished for rationality of any people I ever knew.’ I owned, that the English were easily struck with any thing that appeared ludicrous, and apt to laugh accordingly; but it did not follow, that, because they were more given to laughter, they had more rationality than their neighbours: I said, such an inference would be an injury to the Scots, who were by no means defective in rationality, though generally supposed little subject to the impressions of humour."
1824,"Yes. That would be it, wouldn’t it?” He laughed. “ Good-by, Baron. [SNIPPET] Each one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at 770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders if the suits failed somewhere.” “How about the Bugs?”"
1825,"His shaking hand fumbled with the switch and succeeded in turning on the lamp. Mrs. Calvin C. Kear sprawled on her back in the other bed and snored. "" You and your fifteen-thousand-dollar house,"" Kear muttered. He combed his thinning hair with his fingers. "" You and your sterling silver. You and your chosen pattern. Your service for eight. How far do you think fifty-four dollars a week will go with 12-gauge shells three and a quarter a box?"" [SNIPPET] Miss Tapp sighed as Fred carried her down the outside stairs. A Honeychile Bakery truck, with rear doors open, waited in the driveway. Fred tossed the roll of clothing and the slippers into the truck, and swiftly sprayed Miss Tapp. An unearthly glow permeated the bedroom and cast the black shadows of heavy furniture against the faded papered walls. Within the glow, two dots of green flickered."
1826,"What's that got to do with Donald Crowley?"" The good doctor was embarrassed. "" It seems that she came running out of her suite, umah, semi-dressed and screaming that the hotel was haunted."" ""Good heavens,"" Patricia said with sudden vision. "" That's one aspect I hadn't thought of."" [SNIPPET] Paul Teeter, the heavy-set southerner said jovially, ""But what has this to do with releasing you, Miss O'Gara? Admittedly Dan is a bit indiscreet but...."" He let the sentence fade away. ""Yes,"" Patricia said. "" I realize that he is a nonprofessional in your ranks, and have little doubt that eventually you would have surmounted whatever precautions he has taken to keep you in underling positions. That's beside the point. The point is that by this time Daniel Crowley has, ah, infiltrated the institution you expected to burglarize tonight."
1827,"“It always happens,” said the Gnat.  After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it settled again and remarked, “I suppose you don’t want to lose your name?”  “No, indeed,” Alice said, a little anxiously. [SNIPPET] cried the King. “ How are they getting on with the fight?”  Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of bread-and-butter. “ They’re getting on very well,” he said in a choking voice: “each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.”  “Then I suppose they’ll soon bring the white bread and the brown?” Alice ventured to remark.  “It’s waiting for ’em now,” said Hatta: “this is a bit of it as I’m eating.”  There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn sat down, panting, while the King called out “Ten minutes allowed for refreshments!” Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough trays of white and brown bread."
1828,"""McCann and Karpin,"" he said, ""have been partners—unincorporated, of course—for the last fifteen years. They had found small rare-metal deposits now and again, but they had never found that one big strike all the Belt prospectors waste their lives looking for. Not until the day before McCann died."" ""Ah hah,"" I said. "" Then they found the big strike."" ""Exactly."" ""And McCann's death?"" [SNIPPET] McCann's body, floating around in the blackness, might just be found by somebody. And that, so far as I could see, eliminated the possibilities. McCann's body was in the Belt. I'd eliminated both the asteroids themselves and the space around the asteroids as hiding places. What was left?"
1829,"Of course, no one wanted to bother carrying it around. It was too heavy. The only ones who ever used it, anyway, were members of the council. As the man said, we haven't had a dishonest person in the State for thousands of years. Even I know that much. Of course, this left me with lots of time on my hands. That's how I happened to get her in the first place. [SNIPPET] ""You idiot,"" he shouted. "" Why do you think I had you put out here? It was so I could get in there and help myself to the Treasure."" ""But that would be dishonest. And there are no dishonest people in the State."" ""For three thousand years."
1830,"There was no order, no trace of strong command anywhere. With three hundred well-disciplined troops it seemed to me that I could have sent those poor desperate hordes flying in panic to the forest.  However, there was no very lengthy space of time granted me for thinking out the policy of this matter to any great depth. The attack on the gate had been delivered with suddenness; the repulse was not slow. Of what desperate fighting took place in the galleries, and in the circus between the two sets of gates, the detail will never be told in full.  At the first alarm the great cave-tigers were set loose, and these raged impartially against keeper and foe. Of those that went in through the tunnel, not one in ten returned, and there were few of these but what carried a bloody wound. Some, with the ruling passion still strong in them, bore back plunder; one trailed along with him the head of the captain of the gate; and amongst them they dragged out two of the warders who were wounded, and whom revenge had urged them to take as prisoners. [SNIPPET] Nor shall the other priests rule. Nor Phorenice. Nor anybody. We are done with rulers.”  The press had brought us closer and closer to the man who stood on the war engine. We saw him to be old, with white hair that tumbled on his shoulders, and a long white beard, untrimmed and uncurled. Save for a wisp of rag about the loins, his body was unclothed, and glistened in the wet.  But in his hand he held that which marked his caste."
1831,"""Well, you won't give up so easy on a Spink from now on,"" I says to Zahooli. "" We are heroes and will get medals. First thing we have to do, though,"" I says to Coordinator One sitting in the jet sedan with us, ""is to take care of the hole Earth has in its head. All we have to do is drop that new bomb down the tunnel we made and it will wash up all those subs that are left and most likely cause a flood that will inundate Subterro. [SNIPPET] Behind us in a truck trailer made mostly of transparent duralucite is our captive, the descendant of Adolph Hitler and three dead Subterro beetle people. ""Well, you won't give up so easy on a Spink from now on,"" I says to Zahooli. "" We are heroes and will get medals. First thing we have to do, though,"" I says to Coordinator One sitting in the jet sedan with us, ""is to take care of the hole Earth has in its head. All we have to do is drop that new bomb down the tunnel we made and it will wash up all those subs that are left and most likely cause a flood that will inundate Subterro. What do you think?"""
1832,"In thoughts—thinks escape. Earth."" Maggie paled. "" He is one of us, Simon."" She stepped forward and seized the Venusian's arm. "" You go to your room. Stand guard. You guard Ben just like you guard me. Understand?"" [SNIPPET] Their long fingers played upon the strings of their cirillas or crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider legs. Their tune was sad. Even when they played an Earth tune, it still seemed a song of old Mars, charged with echoes of lost voices and forgotten grandeur. For an instant, Ben's mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead man. He thought, What are they doing here, these Martians? Here, in a smoke-filled room under a metalite dome on a dust-covered world? Couldn't they have played their music on Mars?"
1833,"Doebler's plea by its very impassioned nature had gotten through. It was a moment of embarrassment and indecision in which each man weighed his conscience, and found it wanting ... in which every member of Council looked to his neighbor for solution or solace, and finding neither, turned back to himself, aghast. Only one person looked to the true source and saw the solution as it would be, as it had to be. Pederson. Heartsick with the knowing, he observed Raoul Beardsley and remembered! This funny little man ... this ridiculous man ... this proud man who had seized his fate and shoved it through because it had to be done, because he obeyed the dictates, because he had reached his Time of Assertion. [SNIPPET] Why, that's—"" ""Sure. You think it's crazy. But I tell you I can do it!"""
1834,"But he's a little erratic—quirky, queer sense of humor. Isn't that your impression?"" ""Definitely,"" I said. "" I'd be the last one in the world to say a word against Len, but he was always a little peculiar. Very gay one moment and very sour the next, and inclined to poke fun at things other people take seriously. He used to write poetry."" [SNIPPET] All that happened, though, was that the big toe wriggled a little and the knee buckled. Dud Number Twenty-five. I was sore, of course, especially when I noticed that Kujack was more amused than ever. ""You seem to think something's pretty funny,"" I said."
1835,"The throne was bathed and caressed by a blue vapor of incense, while from the great dome above, filled with figures formed of enamelled glass, there streamed lights of all mysterious colors, that illuminated its gleaming sides and lit up the amphitheatre with ineffable effects. A warm, rosy beam, falling perpendicularly, enveloped the goddess like a robe of transparent tissue. She sat, a living statue, the joy of every heart, the embodiment of a hopeless love that kept the worshipper in a fever of delicious unrest. Wherever the eye wandered, it always came back to the goddess; whatever the soul thought, its last thought was of her. Amid a tempest of music and the thundering song of two hundred thousand voices repeating a litany of love, the throne itself began to revolve upon the silver cone that supported it. A fresh rapture took possession of the multitude. In the soul of the goddess what must have been the joy of being surrounded by such an ocean of adoring love? As I mused on the scene, I thought of the Coliseum at Rome[105] raised to the glory of barbaric force, of empire founded on the blood of its victims, and, being such, has necessarily passed away, becoming a heap of ruins. Here, thought I, is a temple founded on a nobler idea, the glory of the human soul, its ingenuity, art, and spiritual forces. [SNIPPET] Such a soul ought to be free to surround itself with that atmosphere from which it absorbs life. It must choose its own weapons and armor, so as to be adequately equipped for the battle. In its eagerness to climb on discovering wings it must be accompanied by its own retinue of spirits, by enthusiastic and lasting friendships so consoling to its nature. Such was the idea of Egyplosis. Captain Lavornal at this point stated that when the company regained the deck he would put the rotating wheel, placed at the stern of the ship, in motion, so as to produce the combination of a revolving as well as an onward flight. ""These wheels,"" said he, ""will spin us around, and by means of our double rudder we produce both vertical and lateral undulations, which, combined with the rotary movement of the deck, will produce a delirious sensation. All the abandon of great and strong birds are ours."
1836,"But though here and there I could see a dugout, with traces of fire and abandoned tools flung about at random, nowhere in all that dismal world did I observe a living man. After a time I returned to a place near the ruined city by the two rivers; and in the rocky palisades above one of the streams, I made out some small circular holes barely large enough to admit a man. And, borne onward by some impulse of curiosity and despair, I entered one of these holes, and went downward, far downward into the dim recesses. And now for the first time, at a depth of hundreds of yards, I did at last encounter living men. [SNIPPET] Drab as dock-rats, and pasty pale of countenance as hospital inmates, and with bent backs and dirty, tattered clothes and a mouse-like nosing manner, they emerged with the wariness of hunted refugees; and they flung up their hands with low cries to shield them from the brilliance of the sun, to which they were evidently unaccustomed. From the packs on their backs and the bundles in their hands, I knew that they were emerging from their subterranean refuge, to try to begin a new life in the ravaged world above; and my heart went out to them, for I saw that, few as they were—not more than fifty in all—they were the sole survivors of a once-populous region, and would have a bitter fight to wage in the man-made wilderness that had been a world metropolis. But as they roamed above through the waste of ash and rubble, and as they wandered abroad where the fields had been and saw how every brush and tree had been seared from the earth or poisoned by chemical brews, I knew that their fight was not merely a bitter one—it was hopeless. And I heard them muttering among themselves, ""We have not even any tools!"", and again, ""We have no fuel left for the great machines!"" . For they had lived in a highly mechanical world, and the technicians who alone understood the workings of that world had all been destroyed, and the sources of power had all been cut off—and power was the food without which they could not long survive. Unable to endure their haggard, hangdog looks and grim, despondent eyes, I went wandering far away, over the length and breadth of many lands. And nowhere did I see a factory that had not been hammered to dust, nor a village that had not been unroofed or burnt, nor a farm where the workers went humming on their merry, toilsome way."
1837,"The pale eyes grew wholly chill. "" You don't seem to appreciate your situation. You're a prisoner, understand?"" Dalgetty braced his muscles. [SNIPPET] Dalgetty took the glass and gulped thirstily. It was coolness and steadiness spreading through him. The vibratto within him faded, and the headache dulled enough to be endurable. Slowly he looked around, and felt the first crawl of panic. No!"
1838,"That's why I got you mixed up with Ivan at first. But I don't visit him till after I've seen you—I'm running the test chronologically, and nineteen-fifty-two comes before fifteen-seventy, of course."" ""It doesn't,"" Martin said, tilting the glass to his lips. "" Not even in Hollywood does nineteen-fifty-two come before fifteen-seventy."" ""I'm using the Kaldekooz time-scale,"" the robot explained. "" But really only for convenience. Now do you want the ideal ecological differential or don't you? [SNIPPET] There was a brief, crackling flash. The robot withdrew his finger. ""F(t)—"" he said, and swayed slightly. Then his fingers came up and sketched a smile that seemed, somehow, to express delighted surprise. ""Fff(t)!"" he said, and went on rather thickly, ""F(t) integral between plus and minus infinity ... a-sub-n to e...."""
1839,"Trade, regulated by us, will be welcome. Otherwise, should you choose not to be bound by our laws, we must respectfully and finally bid you farewell. When at some future date, we develop ships such as yours, we may reconsider."" The speaker paused, looked at his three confreres, who nodded silently. [SNIPPET] The Great Mother, he thought bitterly, benevolent and overflowing!    Traleres-124, female gardener, aged thirty-two cycles, hummed in a minor key as she harvested weed of the solstice crop, twelve miles off the northern islands. A rest period was due in the next cycle day, and she and her mate were ahead of quota which should make the supervisor give them a good holiday.  The tall weed swayed gently against her and several small fish darted past in fright. As the first heavy beat of the water struck against her slim body, she looked up. Frozen with horror, she released her container, but in forty feet of water, the monster caught her before she had moved a hundred yards."
1840,"""I know just the thing,"" Porteous said happily. "" Here."" He dipped into the glittering litter on the tray and handed Harry Junior a translucent prism. "" A neural distorter. We use it to train regressives on Rigel Two. It might be of assistance."" Melinda eyed the thing doubtfully. Harry Junior was peering into the shifting crystal depths with a somewhat strained expression. ""Speeds up the neural flow,"" explained the little man proudly. "" [SNIPPET] ""Questions?"" There was an ominous glint in Melinda's blue eyes. ""Your delightful primitive customs, art-forms, personal habits—"" ""Look,"" Melinda said, crimsoning. "" This is a respectable neighborhood, and I'm not answering any Kinsey report, understand?"" The little man nodded, scribbling. "" Personal habits are tabu? I so regret. The demonstration."""
1841,"They wouldn't serve it to us if it would. No, men and Lhari are alike in a lot of ways. They breathe the same air. Eat about the same food."" Their bodies were adjusted to about the same gravity. They had the same body chemistry—in fact, you couldn't tell Lhari blood from human, even under a microscope. And in the terrible Orion Spaceport wreck sixty years ago, doctors had found that blood plasma from humans could be used for wounded Lhari, and vice versa, though it wasn't safe to transfuse whole blood. But then, even among humans there were five blood types. [SNIPPET] ""Only a few cuts,"" he said, in Universal, though Meta had spoken Lhari. In his weariness and pain he was homesick for the sound of a familiar word. "" Ringg and I were both caught in the hailstorm. He's badly hurt."" ""Sit down here."" Bart sat. Meta's hands were skillful and cool as she sponged the blood away from his forehead and sprayed it with some pleasantly cold, mint-smelling antiseptic."
1842,"""You look as though a little water might help,"" she agreed, sitting down next to me with her plate. The girl was yanking off her skates. "" And I want one."" ""All right. But go in the house and put on your swim suit."" ""Oh, Mother. Why?"" ""Because, dear, I said so."" [SNIPPET] She twisted my ear and narrowed her eyes even more. "" Like?"" ""Well, when my old man was pumping his first fortune out of some oil wells in Oklahoma, we lived down there. Outside this little town, I found a litter of flat stones that had young black-snakes under each slab. I filled a pail with them and took them into town and dumped them on the walk in front of the movie just as Theda Bara's matinee let out. The best part was that no one had seen me do it. They just couldn't understand how so many snakes got there. I learned how great it can be to stand around quietly and watch people encounter the surprise that you have prepared for them."" She let go of my ear. """
1843,"The ancient glue crackled as she did so. The flap popped open and an old-fashioned order blank fell out. Mr. Hawkins' eyes widened. He bent, reached painfully over his potbelly and picked up the order form. ""This thing has never been processed!"" Raising his voice, he shouted jovially, ""Hey, people! [SNIPPET] Ann's frazzled nerves carried a frantic order to her muscles. She jumped up, strode to the hassock and picked up the manky with two fingers. She tossed it to Les. Immediately, she regretted her action."
1844,"For the results, the cost was worth it. I hand-carried the proposal in. Why not take people through the rooms? We could even design a simulated, usable spacesuit. There'd be airlock doors between the rooms for effectiveness, insulation, economy. No children under ten allowed; no adults over 50. They'd go through in groups of 10 or 11. Sure, I realized this was the most elaborate, most ambitious concession ever planned. The greatest ever attempted in its line, it would cost—both us and the public. [SNIPPET] We'd discovered there's no such thing as a sand storm—it's really dust—so we'd taken pains making things look right. Sand dunes were carefully cemented in place; dust rippling over gave the proper illusion. Oddly shaped rocks, dimly seen, strengthened the impression of wind-abraded topography. Rocks were reddish, overlain by smears of bright yellow. Lot of trouble placing all that flowers of sulfur, but we postulated a liquid sulfur-sulfur dioxide-carbon dioxide cycle. Overhead, a diffused, intense yellow light. The sun—we were on the daylight side. I sighed, relaxed, knowing this one had worked out. We gave the moon little time."
1845,"In his laboratory he now had playful kittens that were six years old and puppies that should have been fully grown dogs. The only human he'd so far experimented on was himself. But because he'd started taking the hormone only recently, he was as yet unable to say positively that it was responsible for the splendid health he was enjoying. His impatience to know the sociological consequences of the hormone had made him bring a sample of it to Staghorn. After sniffing at the bottle, Staghorn had poured its contents into Humanac's analyzer. The giant computer gurgled and belched a few seconds while it assessed the nature of the formula. Then Staghorn connected the analyzer with the machine's memory units. As far as Humanac was concerned, the Y Hormone was now an accepted part of human history. [SNIPPET] For God's sake, shut up,"" one of the men said with more disgust than anger. He pinioned Paul's arms while the other man bound them together with a strip of cloth. Miss Terry meanwhile had collapsed into her chair. One of Paul's captors glanced at her and spoke to the bearded man. """
1846,"Your father would have been proud of you,"" she said. "" Soon you will learn the truth about the Agents."" Beyond the closed door, out of sight of her son, Mrs. Jamieson gave rein to the excitement that ran through her. He had wanted the names! He didn't know why—not yet—but he would. "" He'll do it yet!"" [SNIPPET] ""I wanted to learn the names of the men who killed Father."" He said the word strangely. He was unaccustomed to it. ""Did you find them?"" He pointed to the paper on his desk. Mrs. Jamieson, trembling, picked it up and read the names. Seeing them there, written like any other names would be written, made her furious. How could they? How could the names of murderers look like ordinary names?"
1847,"He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers. There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd been treated properly and would soon disappear. [SNIPPET] It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip something like, ""Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean."" This time she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table. He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move it—she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool embrace at the door—then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it drop out of sight."
1848,"For a moment, uneasiness pricked at him. Yet he was sure Alféar hadn't been lying, and the story the creature had told made more sense than the older superstitions. Henry adjusted his mind to having a well-conditioned demon on tap and then began the harder job of bracing himself for Emma's incoherent but detailed account of the movie when she came back. Unfortunately, it was a more complicated plot than usual, and she went on and on, from the moment she entered the door. He tried to close his ears, but he'd never succeeded in that. [SNIPPET] So here I am, stuck with the habit. Because that's all it is—a conditioned reflex. Pure compulsory behavior. I'm sensitized to receive the summons, and when it comes, I teleport into your plane just the way you pull your hand off a hot stove. You read the whole book, I suppose? Yeah, just my luck. Then you know I'm stuck with any job you give me—practically your slave. I can't even get back without dismissal or finishing your task! That's what comes of saving money by not going to my psychiatrist."""
1849,"Down here with the hot Sun around us, it feels so good and so quiet. You can feel everything spinning and turning. It's nice and sharp and compact. It's sort of like sitting around home."" Woodley grunted. He was not much given to flights of fantasy. Undeterred, Underhill went on, ""It must have been pretty good to have been an Ancient Man. I wonder why they burned up their world with war. They didn't have to planoform. [SNIPPET] They were young. They were good. But they had limitations. So much depended on the choice of Partners, so much on the sheer luck of who drew whom. ather Moontree and the little girl named West entered the room. They were the other two pinlighters."
1850,"## The storage compartment was tiny, barely enough to hold them. ""Drummer will be talking to all ships' Commanders in the combined fleet in less than a minute,"" Brad told them. "" I want to be there when he does so that I can deal with their reactions. Also, Hyk is a problem. I expect they'll all line up against us, including the Plutonian crews. The best we can hope for is a short delay while they argue among themselves. [SNIPPET] White House Press Release, January 14, 2004.  ##  The F  The Interstellar Mining and Teleport S"
1851,"We have far to go."" ""Aren't there any more ledges?"" Johnny asked. ""Small ones,"" Baba answered. "" None are wide like this one. Do you still want to go up?"" ""Maybe we could tie me on some way,"" Johnny said. "" Mountain climbers do it that way."" [SNIPPET] It was the same kind of noise Baba's feet and claws made on stone. The two started out again at a half run. The slope was almost too steep, and Johnny had to slide to a halt to keep from falling. Baba went bouncing along ahead and out of sight. As the slope became steeper yet, Johnny had to slide forward carefully. He stumbled and went down on his back. His flashlight slipped from his hand and went rolling on down the passage and out of sight. In a second it was pitch black. ""Baba,"" Johnny yelled at the top of his lungs."
1852,"And he too stooped to look at my face.”  ‘The wind had left the boat suddenly. The rain began to fall again, and the soft, uninterrupted, a little mysterious sound with which the sea receives a shower arose on all sides in the night. “ They were too taken aback to say anything more at first,” he narrated steadily, “and what could I have to say to them?” [SNIPPET] It’s true—I assure you; as true as I’m sitting here talking about him in vain. He, on his side, had that faculty of beholding at a hint the face of his desire and the shape of his dream, without which the earth would know no lover and no adventurer. He captured much honour and an Arcadian happiness (I won’t say anything about innocence) in the bush, and it was as good to him as the honour and the Arcadian happiness of the streets to another man. Felicity, felicity—how shall I say it?—is quaffed out of a golden cup in every latitude: the flavour is with you—with you alone, and you can make it as intoxicating as you please. He was of the sort that would drink deep, as you may guess from what went before."
1853,"I said, turning my head back to look at her. "" Oh. Well, never mind."" I left the cafe with every outward appearance of casual innocence; but inside I was beginning to realize for the first time the possibilities and the danger that could lie in the use of this new TV development. That had been a Big-Brother-is-Watching-you setup back there in the cafe, except that it had been a girl instead of a man, judging from the style of sun glasses and the smoothness of the nose and forehead. I had wondered about the broadcasting end of things. [SNIPPET] she screamed. "" Get out of my house! I won't have it! You catch that train and get out of town. Do you hear?"" ""But, Aunt Matilda!"" I protested."
1854,"He said, ""Vernher, is there no way out?"" ""Sure,"" Vernher laughed. "" If we go back to savage pre-civilization."" ""All right,"" George said. "" [SNIPPET] ""You mean it, sir?"" ""I've been keeping my eye on you,"" Mr. Perkins said. "" I'll see what I can do."" George thanked him profusely. ""Not at all, not at all,"" Mr. Perkins boomed. "" That's what old dad Perkins is here for."" George got his coffee and joined Charlie at their corner table. ""Getting chummy with old dad Perkins?"" Charlie asked."
1855,"Our screens cannot be so powerful, our beams so effective. What of that?"" asked Roal. ""Their generators were automatically destroyed with the capture of the ship,"" replied X-6349, ""as you know. We know nothing of their system."" [SNIPPET] The investigation machine, scarcely three inches in diameter, crept into the shattered hull and investigated. It was quickly evident that the damage was caused by a fusing ray. Strange life-forms were crawling about the ship, protected by flexible, transparent suits. Their bodies were short, and squat, four-limbed and evidently powerful. They, like insects, were equipped with a thick, durable exoskeleton, horny, brownish coating that covered arms and legs and head. Their eyes projected slightly, protected by horny protruding walls—eyes that were capable of movement in every direction—and there were three of them, set at equal distances apart."
1856,"The engineer threw himself back in his seat. "" I'm with you,"" said he, laying aside his argument. The rest followed his example, and presently were looking upon Sanus again. All told, this particular session covered a good many hours. The four kept up a more or less connected mental conversation with each other as they went along, except, of course, when the events became too exciting. Mainly they were trying to catch their agents in the proper mood for receiving telepathic communications, and it proved no easy matter. It required a state of semi-consciousness, a condition of being neither awake nor asleep. [SNIPPET] ""I'm afraid so!"" The geologist was plainly relieved to have stated the case in full. He leaned forward in his eagerness to be understood. He told the doctor things that were altogether too personal to be included in this account. Meanwhile, out in the doctor's study, Smith had made no move whatever to interrogate the geologist's young wife. Instead, the engineer simply remained standing after Billie had sat down, and gave her only an occasional hurried glance. Shortly the silence got on her nerves; and— such was her nature, as contrasted with Van Emmon's—whereas he had stated causes first, she went straight to effects. ""Well,"" explosively, ""Van and I have split!"" Smith was seldom surprised at anything."
1857,"But the Atlanteans struck first by a matter of hours. At a set moment every volcanic vent on the Earth's surface belched forth colossal volumes of a green gas. Though that gas was harmless to creatures of Earth, it meant slow but certain death to all Rikorians. Furiously the Shining Ones struck their own blow, setting off the cataclysmic explosion that sank Atlantis forever beneath the waters of the Atlantic. [SNIPPET] It was the thought of what would happen in the brief moment of contact when his body met that bare cable that drained the color from Foster's face. There was the terrific electrical energy from a spinning world coursing through that silver strand, a force that in all probability was powerful enough to instantly char a human body to a glowing cinder! If he could only insulate his body at the point where it would touch the cable he might have at least a chance of surviving the contact. The only possible insulating medium he had was the clothing he wore—a pair of heavy corduroy trousers and the sleeveless remnant of a woolen shirt. They could be rolled into a bundle that would be bulky enough to at least give him some protection from contact with the bare cable. Laying the empty pistol on the girder beside him, he stripped as quickly as his precarious perch would permit."
1858,"But was Pat nauseated? Not he! The big goon was lapping it up like a famished feline. His simpering smirk stretched from ear to there as he murmured, ""Now, Miss Thomas—"" ""Sandra, Mr. Pending,"" she sighed softly. "" To you just plain ... Sandy. [SNIPPET] ""Or,"" she continued hopefully, ""if Pat wants to, we could make two double shares, and split it fifty-fifty?"" From the look in Pat's eyes I knew he was stunned by this possibility. And from the look in hers, I felt she was going to make every effort to take advantage of his bewilderment. So, as I said before, what this country needs is a good cigar-shaped spaceship."
1859,"You see?"" ""Yes,"" another of them said. "" But what amazes me is that this old man picked this planet out of all the others. The only one in this entire sector that would sustain life."" ""Maybe he was just a very lucky old man. Yes ... a man who attains such an age was usually lucky. Or at least that is what they say about the lost sectors."" ""Maybe he knew the way here. [SNIPPET] You never know where you'll find people on a world somewhere nobody's ever named or knows about. Places where a lost ship's landed and never got up again, or wrecked itself so far off the lanes they'll never be found except by accident for millions of years. That's what this world is, boys. Must have been a ship load of beautiful people, maybe actresses and people like that being hauled to some outpost to entertain."
1860,"He was pretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little vain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability to make the rounds in two minutes, every time. Every time but this. For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close. The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was Flock—astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't been in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there was something that glinted and smoked. ""All right,"" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut with pain. [SNIPPET] Trouble?"" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his little round eyes looked terrified—as perhaps they should have. Warden Godfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in the Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the last decent job he would have in his life. ""Trouble? What trouble?"" O'Leary shrugged. "" Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This afternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard."""
1861,"Emilia, whose caution was equally vigilant and commendable, foreseeing that she might be exposed to the fertility of his invention, came home by a private passage, and entered by a postern, which was altogether unknown to her admirer; and her uncle did not arrive until it was so late that he could not, with any decency, demand a conference.  Next morning, he did not fail to present himself at the door, and his mistress being denied by her own express direction, insisted upon seeing the master of the house, who received him with such coldness of civility, as plainly gave him to understand that he was acquainted with the displeasure of his niece. He, therefore, with an air of candour, told the citizen, he could easily perceive by his behaviour that he was the confidant of Miss Emily, of whom he was come to ask pardon for the offence he had given; and did not doubt, if he could be admitted to her presence, that he should be able to convince her that he had not erred intentionally, or at least propose such reparation as would effectually atone for his fault.  To this remonstrance the merchant, without any ceremony or circumlocution, answered, that though he was ignorant of the nature of his offence, he was very certain, that it must have been something very flagrant that could irritate his niece to such a degree, against a person for whom she had formerly a most particular regard. He owned, she had declared her intention to renounce his acquaintance for ever, and, doubtless, she had good reason for so doing; neither would he undertake to promote an accommodation, unless he would give him full power to treat on the score of matrimony, which he supposed would be the only means of evincing his own sincerity, and obtaining Emilia's forgiveness. Peregrine's pride was kindled by this blunt declaration, which he could not help considering as the result of a scheme concerted betwixt the young lady and her uncle, in order to take advantage of his heat. [SNIPPET] I caught them in the fact of suffocating me with cold water; and by the Lord, I will be revenged, or may I never live to finish my Cleopatra. For the love of God! open the door, and I will make that conceited pagan, that pretender to taste, that false devotee of the ancients, who poisons people with sillykicabies and devil's dung—I say, I will make him a monument of my wrath, and an example to all the cheats and impostors of the faculty; and as for that thick-headed insolent pedant, his confederate, who emptied my own jordan upon me while I slept, he had better have been in his beloved Paris, botching schemes for his friend the Pretender, than incur the effects of my resentment. Gadsbodikins! I won't leave him a windpipe for the hangman to stop, at the end of another rebellion.”  Pickle told him his conduct had been so extravagant as to confirm the whole company in the belief that he was actually deprived of his senses: on which supposition, Mr. Jolter and the doctor had acted the part of friends, in doing that which they thought most conducive to his recovery: so that their concern merited his thankful acknowledgment, instead of his frantic menaces: that, for his own part, he would be the first to condemn him, as one utterly bereft of his wits, and give orders for his being secured as a madman, unless he would immediately give a proof of his sanity by laying aside his sword, composing his spirits, and thanking his injured friends for their care of his person.  This alternative quieted his transports in a moment: he was terrified at the apprehension of being treated like a bedlamite, being dubious of the state of his own brain; and, on the other hand, had conceived such a horror and antipathy for his tormentors, that, far from believing himself obliged by what they had done, he could not even think of them without the utmost rage and detestation."
1862,"Nothing came through, and nothing moved in the other world but leaves stirring now and then with a breeze, clouds drifting across the sky. Ed began to realize it was getting late in the morning, and he had not yet had breakfast. He left old Tom to watch the hole, got stiffly to his feet and went on down the trail to get the pail of water he had started for. From the cabin door, he could still see the hole into the other world. [SNIPPET] Taking the bug gun in his left hand and the flashlight in his right, he stooped over to shine the light in, keeping as well clear of the entrance as possible. All in all, he must have got about a five-second look, which is a lot longer than it sounds when things are happening. His first impression was a jumble—eyes, scurrying movement, and bulk. Then things started to shape up. About ten feet back from the entrance was a huge, flattish, naked, scabrous bulk, pimpled with finger-sized teats. Clustered around and behind this were a tangle of slinging units, carrier units, observation units. Some had their mouths fixed to teats."
1863,"""Is it lung trouble?"" inquired Aunt McCorkle sympathetically. The girl came out of the house at this moment and sat down on the veranda under the white camellia. She glanced at her guest with interest. ""The doctors think I shall come out all right if I am careful of my self,"" replied Ellesworth, evasively. ""It is hard to be sick,"" said Georgiella sincerely. Illness and death had touched her so lately and so cruelly that she could not help feeling sorry for the sick young man. [SNIPPET] ""Yes; that's them!"" He pitched his orotund voice upon me as if he were giving a command in a gale at sea. Men now began to gesticulate wildly at the ill-fated boat from the rocks, as if that could help the matter. ""Drop that mains'l, you —— fools, or you'll go to ——!"" The voices struck me like a volley of bullets, but they could not have penetrated ten feet to windward. ""Scud!"""
1864,"Little spicules licked out from their flexing stalks and jabbed, unsensed, into Cully's body to draw nourishment. From the manythoughts came the sense of complete fulfillment. From Cully's mind came further orders. Lie down. It was a collective concept. Lie still. We are friends. [SNIPPET] Here it is! Cully's mind shouted. Cully's mind was held, hypnotized, but his body moved of its own volition. He moved again."
1865,"The first man to invent a road-map all citizens could unfold and understand was a Spink."" Zmorro turns to Zahooli and Wurpz. "" Don't ask us anythin'!"" they yelp in unison. "" You would only git a silly answer."" ""A world inside of a world you said once, Spink. [SNIPPET] I asks Zahooli. "" We got enough stored up to go seventy million miles into space? We'll cross that bridge when we get to the river."" ""You mean the Styx?"" ""That is one thing I will not believe,"" I sniff. "" We will never find Attila the Hun or Hitler down there. Or Beelzebub."""
1866,"Is that too much to ask, lording?”  Was there ever such an idiot butcher? thought the Sheriff; and he so far forgot his dignity as to nudge the Bishop in his fat ribs.  “Nay, good fellow,” quoth he chuckling, “I am always ready to help any in my shire. An you cannot find a buyer for your herd at this just figure, I will e’en buy them myself.”  At this generosity Robin was quite overcome, and fell to praising the Sheriff to the skies, and telling him that he should not have cause to forget the kindness.  “Tut, tut,” said the Sheriff, “‘tis naught but a trade. [SNIPPET] he said. “ You have killed a King’s deer, and by the laws of King Harry your head remains forfeit. Talk not to me of pennies but get ye gone straight, and let me not look upon your face again.”  Rob’s blood boiled within him, and he uttered a rash speech. “"
1867,"""I see, I see—it is the same thing. It is wonderful. In the one case a man lies dead-alive four generations—mummified in ignorance and sloth—and that qualifies him to command live people, and take their weal and woe into his impotent hands; and in the other case, a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations, and that qualifies him for office in the celestial camp. Does the king's grace approve of this strange law?"" The king said: ""Why, truly I see naught about it that is strange. [SNIPPET] I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it."
1868,"""Settle down, foolish one,"" said Buos, not unkindly. "" I know your feelings. Do you think I am not tormented as well, by the slow pace of these Earth-things? Crude, barbaric beings, like children with the building blocks of science. [SNIPPET] ""No, they will not! We have watched him. He understands much. He will help us!"" ""I have seen his like before,"" said Buos hopelessly. "" He thinks and he works, and his conclusions will die stillborn, for lack of a moving force ..."""

1870,"His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.  Wine.  He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.  —Yes, he said. He’s the organiser in point of fact.  No fear: no brains.  Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.  —He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. [SNIPPET] A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.  Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun."
1871,"That seemed self-evident, but George had no way of knowing if any other man had ever reasoned out the same conclusion. Maybe he was unique because of his immunity to the compound. He was sure that very few men—possibly none—had reached marriage age with their immunity still undiscovered. eorge was lucky, in a way: he knew the truth about himself when he was seven, and he had time to adjust to it—to plan the role he had been acting for the past twelve years. His early childhood had been a livid nightmare, primarily because of the precocious cruelty of his two sisters. Shortly before his seventh birthday they forced him to take part in a game they called cocktail party. The game involved only one activity: the two little girls filled a glass with an unidentified liquid, and ordered George to drink. [SNIPPET] The automatic circuit snapped on the television screen above his bunk; wearily George fixed his eyes on the unreeling love story. For as long as he could remember, television had been a fundamental part of his education. A federal law required every male to watch the TV romances three hours a day. Failure to do so—and that was determined by monthly form tests mailed out by the Directorate—meant a three month sentence to the national hero's corps. If the statistics periodically published by the Directorate were true, George was a relatively rare case, having survived adolescence without serving a single tour of duty as a national hero."
1872,"""I'm sorry,"" Jordan said, ""but I'm going to lie down in my cabin until we are given clearance."" He opened the door of the little room and went into the hall. He walked down past his own cabin and stopped in front of another door, a new one that was sheathed in permallium. He hesitated a few moments; then he snapped open the outside latch and walked in, letting the door swing closed behind him. Hall lay unmoving in the middle of the floor, his legs and arms fastened in greaves of permallium. Jordan was embarrassed. He did not look directly at the robot. ""I don't know whether you want to talk to me or not,"" he started. "" [SNIPPET] I d-didn't bring anything in."" ""Sign the affidavit,"" the agent said and pushed a sheet of paper toward him. The traveler picked up a pen from the desk and signed ""Jon Hall"" in a clear, perfect script. The agent gave it a passing glance and tossed it into a wire basket. Then he pushed his uniform cap back exposing a bald head. "" You're my last customer for a while, until the rocket from Sirius comes in. Guess I might as well relax for a minute."" He reached into a drawer of the desk and pulled out a package of cigarettes, of which he lit one. ""You been in the war, too?"""
1873,"I know you will."" He remembered the long winter evenings of study at his father's great mahogany desk, pouring over medical books and journals, taking notes, sifting and re-sifting facts. He remembered one set of books in particular—Erickson's monumental three-volume text on surgery, richly bound and stamped in gold. He had always loved these books, above all others. What had gone wrong along the way? Somehow, the dream had faded, the bright goal vanished and was lost. After a year of pre-med at the University of Southern Cal, he had given up medicine; he had become discouraged and quit college to take a laborer's job with a construction company. How ironic that this move should have saved his life! [SNIPPET] He forced his thoughts away from the scene in his mind away from the horror; quickly he stood up and began to unload the box, placing the cans on a long shelf along the far side of the room. He began to think of women, of a girl named Joan, and of how much he had loved her . The world of Lewis Stillman was damp and lightless; it was narrow and its cold stone walls pressed in upon him as he moved. He had been walking for several hours; sometimes he would run, because he knew his leg muscles must be kept strong, but he was walking now, following the thin yellow beam of his hooded lantern. He was searching. Tonight, he thought, I might find another like myself."
1874,"You son of a bitch!"" he remarked feelingly, and followed the others. I waited until it was reasonably sure that the Inter-Alia group had left the building. Then I went downstairs to the bar and found Tammy alone. ""Tammy,"" I said. "" You overheard our conversation down the dummy, didn't you?"" ""Oh no, sir. [SNIPPET] Meet me anywhere, Winnie!' That's cute. ' Meet' and 'Meat,' see? Our representative will call on you."" I asked Arthurjean to send in the next visitor and to my surprise she announced DeForest. ""Hell!"" I told her. "" There must have been others ahead of him."""
1875,"The Aeropher maintained a uniform height of five thousand feet, sufficiently high to give us the exultation of a bird, yet sufficiently deep to allow the sublimity of the scene to fully impress us. The musicians, who had hitherto remained in abeyance, now broke the silence of our progress with a swelling refrain. The music rolled echoing from granite to jasper walls in strains of divine pathos. We seemed to sail through the fabled realms of enchantment. In that little moving heaven, ceremony was dissolved into a thrilling friendship; the harmonious surroundings created a closer union of souls. Above where I sat with Lyone there floated a flag of yellow silk a hundred feet in length. As it floated on the wind it assumed a varying series of poetic shapes, very beautiful to witness. Sometimes there was a long sinuous fold, then a number of rippling waves, then a second fold only shorter than the first, then more rippling waves. [SNIPPET] The consequence was I had awakened in my mind an enthusiasm to penetrate the sublime secret of the pole. I longed to stand, as it were, on the roof of the world and see beneath me the great globe revolve on its axis. There, where there is neither north, nor south, nor east, nor west, I could survey the frozen realms of death. I would dare to stand on the very pole itself with my few hardy companions, monarch of an empire of ice, on a spot that never feels the life-sustaining revolutions of the earth. I knew that on the equator, where all is light, life, and movement, continents and seas flash through space at the rate of one thousand miles an hour, but on the pole the wheeling of the earth is as dead as the desolation that surrounds it. I had conversed with Arctic navigators both in England and the United States. Some believed the pole would never be discovered."
1876,"Wayne said, ""Yes. Do you mind telling me what you want a high dragon bump for?"" ""Blast away hearth,"" the Cirissin replied unhesitatingly. Wayne swallowed and found it unnaturally difficult to do so. ""To blast away earth?"" [SNIPPET] Gluck."" Metal slammed against metal. Wayne slammed against something hard. And darkness closed in once again. But this time it wasn't so smothering and didn't last nearly so long. When he opened his eyes his head was clear. He wasn't floating. He was lying on something hard—a floor surface of the Cirissin landing ship. He didn't ache anywhere."
1877,"I don't like the look of them."" The orderly swarms of figures, which were rapidly filling the park, divided as he was speaking, making a broad lane from one of its entrances to where the Astronef was hanging above the air-ship. A light four-wheeled vehicle, whose framework and wheels glittered like burnished gold, sped towards them, driven by some invisible agency. Its only occupant was a huge man, dressed in the universal costume, saving only a scarlet sash in place of the cord-girdle which the others wore round their waists. The vehicle stopped near the air-ship, over which the Astronef was hanging, and, as the figure dismounted, a door opened in the side of the vessel and three other figures, similar both in stature and attire, came out and entered into conversation with him. ""The Admiral of the Fleet is evidently making his report,"" said Redgrave. "" [SNIPPET] The two islands were divided by a broad, straight stretch of water about the width of the English Channel between Folkestone and Boulogne. Instead of the bright blue-green of terrestrial seas, this connecting link between the great Northern and Southern Martian oceans had an orange tinge. The land immediately beneath them was of a gently undulating character, something like the Downs of South-Eastern England. No mountains were visible in any direction. The lower portions, particularly along the borders of the canals and the sea, were thickly dotted with towns and cities, apparently of enormous extent. To the north of the Island Continent there was a peninsula, which was covered with a vast collection of buildings, which, with the broad streets and spacious squares which divided them, must have covered an area of something like two hundred square miles."
1878,"The strange thing was that it did have a lot of good things to recommend it. Or had had them. It had solved the problem of intimate communication and driven back the tides of loneliness. It had lessened the dangers of mental and physical illnesses in the material bodies and assured a prolongation of the life of each body, which was important in itself, for this trip had proven to be a lot longer than even the most pessimistic had anticipated. The Crew, pulsing in its tank, Kelly thought oddly, is a new life form. One that had evolved to meet the exigencies of deep space which had proven to be alien to any adaptability common to any world that rotated through it. But maybe they were too damn happy, Kelly thought. Too contented. If they ran into a real emergency now, the ship would be finished. [SNIPPET] This time it seemed to be almost entirely someone else. He stared at the face in the chrome, then whispered the hell with that and he flipped the controls over to manual. He sat down. Behind him, the Crew whispered in its tank, protoplasm developed in the labs and quivering now with some unified sensation that was purely subjective and blissfully unconcerned with what happened outside itself."
1879,"His ruby eyes, to his associate, looked pained, as well they might.  ""Let me pose a question, Honored Sirs,"" said Powers. "" Suppose that in your early history of creating your orderly realm you had discovered on one of your islands a race of Falsethsa as advanced and regulated as yourselves who wished nothing to do with you?"" He could feel the alerted tension of the four as the golden eyes glowed at him. [SNIPPET] ""Let me pose a question, Honored Sirs,"" said Powers. "" Suppose that in your early history of creating your orderly realm you had discovered on one of your islands a race of Falsethsa as advanced and regulated as yourselves who wished nothing to do with you?"" He could feel the alerted tension of the four as the golden eyes glowed at him.  ""The implications of your question are obvious,"" the First of the Council spoke, as coldly as ever. "" Do you threaten us with force from your Combine devoted to peace?"""
1880,"I glanced around and started to say, a measuring glass on a dirty plate next to half a cold fried egg, but she stopped me with a sweep of her arm which came dangerously close to the flasks and retorts—all holding dirtycolored liquids—which cluttered the sink. "" No, no. I mean outside."" I couldnt see outside, because instead of a window I was facing a sickly leaf unaccountably preserved in a jar of alcohol. I said nothing. [SNIPPET] She twisted her hands together. "" Not responsible! Why, you are responsible for every brutality, execution, meanness and calamity in the world today!"" I had often heard that the borderline between profundity and insanity was thin and inexact and it was now clear on which side she stood. I looked at Gootes to see how he was taking her hysterical outburst, but he had found a batch of empty testtubes which he was building into a perilously swaying structure. ""Of course, of course,"" I agreed soothingly, backing away. """
1881,"""I, President Reen Narval, hereby declare and proclaim that Planet Pluto, as an independent and properly constituted member of the Independent Nations of the Outer Region (INOR), has the legal and inalienable right to use and to defend INOR territory under my jurisdiction consistent with time-honored custom and interplanetary law.

[SNIPPET] Initially in Earth orbit, later in lunar space and on Luna itself, they guided settlers in developing new lifestyles and colonizing skills, and showed them how to wrest and refine usable elements and minerals from nearby sources. They devised and tested methodologies to convert crude space matter into forms with which to create and integrate structures, and manufacture and operate machines and networks that would sustain surface and contiguous space and inter-satellite and interplanetary navigation and logistics systems. The emigrants procreated and populated their cities in the void. Their disparate ancestries blended through a natural vitality that accelerated human evolution so as to survive in a radically new environment."
1882,"asked Tee. The bartender chuckled. "" I see you don't know too much about Thymis. Sometimes it drops to ninety at night, but not too often. You ought to be here sometime when the clouds part for a minute. If you're caught outside then, it's third-degree burns for sure."" He glanced down at the nearly empty glass. "" [SNIPPET] Besides, this planet has some interesting customs."" He winked at Tee. "" I can introduce you—"" ""I can't stay here,"" interrupted Tee. "" You just don't understand."" ""Look,"" cried the redhead exasperatedly, ""I'm offering you a full partnership on a two million credit salvage deal and you want to back out because it'll take six months."
1883,"600. The action of acids was far more constant and satisfactory. A platina plate was boiled in dilute nitric acid: being washed and put into mixed oxygen and hydrogen gases, it acted well. Other plates were boiled in strong nitric acid for periods extending from half a minute to four minutes, and then being washed in distilled water, were found to act very well, condensing one cubic inch and a half of gas in the space of eight or nine minutes, and rendering the tube warm (570.). 601. Strong sulphuric acid was very effectual in rendering the platina active. A plate (569.) was heated in it for a minute, then washed and put into the mixed oxygen and hydrogen, upon which it acted as well as if it had been made the positive pole of a voltaic pile (570.).

1884,"""Sixty millions! Why I feel almost at home again."" ""But we have to turn the corner of the street yet, dear, and after that there's a fall of more than twenty-five million miles on to the more or less kindly breast of Mother Earth."" ""A fall! It does sound rather awful when you put it that way; but I am not going to let you frighten me. I believe Mother Earth will receive her wandering children quite as kindly as they deserve."" The moon-like disc of Venus grew swiftly smaller, and the black spot on the face of the Sun larger and larger as the Astronef rushed silently and imperceptibly, and yet with almost inconceivable velocity towards doom or fortune. Neither Zaidie nor Redgrave spoke again for nearly three hours—hours which to them seemed to pass like so many minutes. Their eyes were fixed on the black disc of Mercury, which, as they approached it, expanded with magical rapidity till it completely eclipsed the blazing orb behind it. [SNIPPET] Then one or two, more daring, put their little hands up to his face and touched his moustache, and all of them, while both examinations were going on, kept up a running conversation of cooing and singing which evidently conveyed their ideas from one to the other on the subject of this most marvellous visit of these two strange beings with neither wings nor feathers, but who, most undoubtedly, had other means of flying, since it was quite certain that they had come from another world. Their ordinary speech was a low crooning note, like the language in which doves converse, mingled with a twittering current of undertone. But every moment it rose into higher notes, evidently expressing wonder or admiration, or both. ""You were right about the universal language,"" said Redgrave, when he had submitted to the stroking process for a few moments. "" These people talk in music, and, as far as I can see or hear, their opinion of us, or, at least, of you, is distinctly flattering. I don't know what they take me for, and I don't care, but as we'd better make friends with them suppose you sing them 'Home, Sweet Home,' or the 'Swanee River.' I shouldn't wonder if they consider our talking voices most horrible discords, so you might as well give them something different."""
1885,"Blocked in her effort to relieve human poverty by the discovery that its existence was not recognized, Marguerite's next adventure in doing good in the world was to take up the battle against ignorance by contributing to the School for the Education of Servants. The Servant problem in Berlin, and particularly on the Royal Level, had been solved so far as male servants were concerned, for these were a well recognized strain eugenically bred as a division of the intellectual caste. I had once taken Dr. Zimmern to task on this classification of the servant as an intellectual. ""The servant is not intellectual creatively,"" the Eugenist replied, ""yet it would never do to class him as Labour since he produces nothing. Moreover, the servant's mind reveals the most specialized development of the most highly prized of all German intellectual characteristics--obedience. [SNIPPET] ""You are much changed,"" he said at last. "" I hardly recognize you."" ""I have been very ill,"" I replied. Just then the head physician came into the room and seeing me talking to a stranger walked over to us. As I said nothing, Holknecht introduced himself. The medical man began at once to enlarge upon the peculiarities of my condition. "" The unknown gas,"" he explained, ""acted upon the whole nervous system and left profound effects. Never in the records of the hospital has there been so strange a case."""
1886,"She looked him over carefully and then shrugged her shoulder, not quite dislodging the upper portion of her suit. "" Suitcha self."" After a while she asked, ""What business ya in?"" ""I'm sort of retired,"" he explained, finding her very charming and refreshing to talk to. "" I had a modest income a while ago. [SNIPPET] Suitcha self."" After a while she asked, ""What business ya in?"" ""I'm sort of retired,"" he explained, finding her very charming and refreshing to talk to. "" I had a modest income a while ago."
1887,"A yell broke from him. I had thrust the needle into his arm just above one swollen wrist and had quickly shot the drug through. He struggled to release himself and then began to rock drunkenly. The morphine, taking him in his weakness, worked quickly. [SNIPPET] The Suwarna's ability to make her twelve knots an hour without it had made me very fully forgive her for not being as fragrant as the Javan flower for which she was named. Da Costa, her captain, was a garrulous Portuguese; his mate was a Canton man with all the marks of long and able service on some pirate junk; his engineer was a half-breed China-Malay who had picked up his knowledge of power plants, Heaven alone knew where, and, I had reason to believe, had transferred all his religious impulses to the American built deity of mechanism he so faithfully served. The crew was made up of six huge, chattering Tonga boys.  The Suwarna had cut through Finschafen Huon Gulf to the protection of the Bismarcks. She had threaded the maze of the archipelago tranquilly, and we were then rolling over the thousand-mile stretch of open ocean with New Hanover far behind us and our boat's bow pointed straight toward Nukuor of the Monte Verdes. After we had rounded Nukuor we should, barring accident, reach Ponape in not more than sixty hours.  It was late afternoon, and on the demure little breeze that marched behind us came far-flung sighs of spice-trees and nutmeg flowers."
1888,"Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine course, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left and right. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and held together with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it flowed up the rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old cut out its way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with here and there, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at low water, full of holes where crabs and lobsters were to be found at the ebb of the tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used for warping in the little coasting vessels which frequented the port. Higher up, the stream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far inland, but always calmly for all the force of the wildest storm was broken below. Some quarter mile inland the stream was deep at high water, but at low tide there were at each side patches of the same broken rock as lower down, through the chinks of which the sweet water of the natural stream trickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed away. Here, too, rose mooring posts for the fishermen’s boats. [SNIPPET] There was only one chance, and I took it. I hurled myself across the dyke, and escaping out of the very clutches of my foes threw myself into the stream. At any other time I should have thought that water foul and filthy, but now it was as welcome as the most crystal stream to the parched traveller. It was a highway of safety! My pursuers rushed after me."
1889,"Quirl ejaculated. "" Are you Burroughs, the traitor?"" Immediately he regretted his heedlessness. Strom's face darkened in anger, and for a moment the pirate captain did not reply. When he did he was a little calmer. [SNIPPET] But it did not knock out Gore, and Quirl had to pay dearly for his error. Gore was staggered, but his mighty arms closed, hugging his slighter opponent to his hairy chest so that the breath was choked out of him, and the metal studs on his harness gouged cruelly into Quirl's flesh. His face was blue before he could work his arm loose, and begin to prod with stiffened fingers at Gore's throat. Gore had to let go then, and Quirl broke away, boxed for a few moments until he had recovered, and then proceeded to chop Gore's face beyond any semblance of humanity. The mate had dropped his ray weapon, and now searched for it with blinded eyes. He flung his riot club, and it flew wide of the mark. It was obvious that he was going to be beaten into insensibility. The guard on the platform, seeing the trend of the battle, shouted hoarsely up the well, and in a few minutes four men, hard-bitten, villainous looking fellows, tumbled down the ladder and joyously joined in the fray."
1890,"I can't figure out whether the Flimbotzik themselves are vegetarians because they practice mpoola, or practice mpoola because they're—"" ""I don't want to hear another word about mpoola or about Flimbot!"" Iversen yelled. "" Get out of here! And stay away from the library!"" ""I have already exhausted its painfully limited resources, sir."" [SNIPPET] I always suspect friendly life-forms. Friendliness simply isn't a natural instinct."" ""Who's being anthropomorphic now!"" Harkaway chided. Iversen flushed, for he had berated the young man for that particular fault on more than one occasion. Harkaway was too prone to interpret alien traits in terms of terrestrial culture. Previously, since all intelligent life-forms with which the Herringbone had come into contact had already been discovered by somebody else, that didn't matter too much. In this instance, however, any mistakes of contact or interpretation mattered terribly."
1891,"""I see. Look, take a chance that he can't read minds and tell me, did he kill the man in the bed you should have been in."" Snake paused for a minute. Then nodded. ""Do you think he was trying to kill you?"" Snake nodded again. ""Did you know that the man killed this morning in your place was one of the two men who came back from Aptor with the Priestess?"" [SNIPPET] inquired Geo. "" Is he a god of Aptor under whom these forces are being marshaled? And are these jewels sacred to him in some way?"" ""Both are true, and both are not true enough,"" replied the priestess."
1892,"""What is the purpose of the experiment this time?"" asked the small dark Federation agent genially. ""To determine the safe limits of silicon consumption and if there are any dangers in an overdose."" ""How do you determine that? By dropping dead?"" [SNIPPET] He could be right. Perhaps the test should be stopped. Every day, with growing uneasiness, Alcala took his dose of silicon compound, and every day, the chemical seemed to be absorbed completely—not released or excreted—in a way that was unpleasantly reminiscent of the way arsenic accumulated without evident damage, then killed abruptly without warning. Already, this evening, he had noticed that there was something faulty about his coordination and weight and surface sense. The restaurant door had swung back with a curious lightness, and the hollow metal handle had had a curious softness under his fingers."
1893,"It was on the same day that Dr. Ashton, looking out of an upper window, saw the two boys playing in the corner of the garden at a game he did not understand. Frank was looking earnestly at something in the palm of his hand. Saul stood behind him and seemed to be listening. After some minutes he very gently laid his hand on Frank's head, and almost instantly thereupon, Frank suddenly dropped whatever it was that he was holding, clapped his hands to his eyes, and sank down on the grass. Saul, whose face expressed great anger, hastily picked the object up, of which it could only be seen that it was glittering, put it in his pocket, and turned away, leaving Frank huddled up on the grass. Dr. Ashton rapped on the window to attract their attention, and Saul looked up as if in alarm, and then springing to Frank, pulled him up by the arm and led him away. When they came in to dinner, Saul explained that they had been acting a part of the tragedy of Radamistus, in which the heroine reads the future fate of her father's kingdom by means of a glass ball held in her hand, and is overcome by the terrible events she has seen. During this explanation[Pg 12] Frank said nothing, only looked rather bewilderedly at Saul. [SNIPPET] But, as I said, it was dreadful near this night; and on the top of the start I got with hearing it, I got another fright; for I heard something rustling outside in the passage. Now to be sure I thought I was done; but I noticed the dog seemed to perk up a bit, and next there was some one whispered outside the door, and I very near laughed out loud, for I knew it was my father and mother that had got out of bed with the noise. ' Whatever is it?' says my[Pg 99] mother. ' Hush! I don't know,' says my father, excited-like, 'don't disturb the boy. I hope he didn't hear nothing.'"
1894,"Back and forth the writer paced, baring his inmost thoughts ... His wife was desperately ill and the future looked completely black. How could he summon the strength of will to go on, let alone to write? He said fiercely, ""It's all right for you to talk—"" He stopped, seeming to realize for the first time that the big man sitting in an easy chair by the window had made no attempt to speak. It seemed incredible, but the big man had listened in complete silence, and with such quiet assurance that his silence had taken on an eloquence that inspired absolute trust. He had always known there were a few people like that in the world, people whose sympathy and understanding you could take for granted. There was a fearlessness in such people which made them stand out from the crowd, stone-markers in a desert waste to lend assurance to a tired wayfarer by its sturdy permanence, its sun-mirroring strength. There were a few people like that in the world but you sometimes went a lifetime without meeting one. The big man sat there smiling at him, calmly exuding the serenity of one who has seen life from its tangled, inaccessible roots outward and testifies from experience that the entire growth is sound. [SNIPPET] The boy and the girl walked toward the door together, a young and extremely pretty girl and a boy grown suddenly to the full stature of a man. Rather regretfully Moonson watched them go. As they reached the door the girl turned and smiled and the boy paused too—and they both smiled suddenly at the man in the bathing trunks. Then they were gone. Moonson got up as they disappeared, left the tavern. It was dark when he reached the cabin. He was dog-tired, and when he saw the seated man through the lighted window a great longing for companionship came upon him. He forgot that he couldn't talk to the man, forgot the language difficulty completely."
1895,"I was sown in weakness, but was raised in power, strength being made perfect in weakness. Therefore improve your fellows, though yourself you cannot raise. The knowledge that you have sent many souls to heaven, though you are yourself a castaway, will give you unspeakable joy, and place you in heaven wherever you may be. Yet remember this: none of us can win heaven; salvation is the gift of God. I have said as much now as you can remember. Farewell. Improve time while you can. Fear God and keep His commandments. This is the whole duty of man."" [SNIPPET] ""This,"" said Bearwarden, ""will be a good place to camp, for the cave will protect us from dragons, unless they should take a notion to breathe at us from the outside, and it will keep us dry in case of rain. To-morrow we can start with this as a centre, and make another circuit."" ""We can explore Saturn on foot,"" said Cortlandt, ""and far more thoroughly than Jupiter, on account of its comparative freedom from monsters. Not even the dragons can trouble us, unless we meet them in large numbers."" Thereupon they set about getting fuel for their fire."
1896,"“Oh, yes?” she said, her voice dripping danger. “ I can speak this language too, you know—I learned it years ago, before the gate to this world was closed! And let me tell you something else....” She told him something else. [SNIPPET] Now, I’ll just.... Ah!” She strode directly to Ray’s invention, and Farmer wondered why both the aliens were so interested in a gadget that didn’t work. Dor wasted no time. She bent over, picked up the machine, yanking wiring loose carelessly, straightened up, turned a beaming smile on Farmer and Ray, said “Goodbye,” and headed for the rail. Ray yelped. He started after her, but his progress in the diving suit was waddling and slow. She reached the rail first and went over. Ray was not too far behind, and he slammed his helmet down angrily as he reached the rail."
1897,"Below him was a wide, park-like space, green with emerald lawns, and bright with flowering plants. Two hundred yards across it rose an immense pyramidal building—an artistic structure, gleaming with white marble and bright metal, striped with the verdure of terraced roof-gardens, its slender peak rising to help support the gray, steel-ribbed glass roof above. Beyond, the park stretched away in illimitable vistas, broken with the graceful columned buildings that held up the great glass roof. Above the glass, over this New York of 2432 A. D., a freezing blizzard was sweeping. But small concern was that to the lightly clad man at the window, who was inhaling deeply the fragrant air from the plants below—air kept, winter and summer, exactly at 20° C With another yawn, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding turned back to the room, which was bright with the rich golden light that poured in from the suspended globes of the cold ato-light that illuminated the snow-covered city. With a distasteful grimace, he seated himself before a broad, paper-littered desk, sat a few minutes leaning back, with his hands clasped behind his head. At last he straightened reluctantly, slid a small typewriter out of its drawer, and began pecking at it impatiently. [SNIPPET] ""Not altogether. But I should worry! Here comes breakfast. Let me butter your toast."" A bell had rung at the shaft. She ran to it, and returned with a great silver tray, laden with dainty dishes, which she set on a little side table. They sat down opposite each other, and ate, getting as much satisfaction from contemplation of each other's faces as from the excellent food. When they had finished, she carried the tray to the shaft, slid it in a slot, and touched a button—thus disposing of the culinary cares of the morning. She ran back to Eric, who was once more staring distastefully at his typewriter."
1898,"Ten thousand giant ships, shining dully in the radiance of a far-off blue-white sun, met ten thousand tiny, darting motes, ten thousand tiny machine-ships capable of maneuvering far more rapidly than the giants. Tremendous induction beams snapped out through the dark, star-flecked space, to meet tremendous screens that threw them back and checked them. Then all the awful power of annihilating matter was thrown against them, and titanic flaming screens reeled back under the force of the beams, and the screens of the ships from Outside flamed gradually violet, then blue, orange—red—the interference was getting broader, and ever less effective. Their own beams were held back by the very screens that checked the enemy beams, and not for the briefest instant could matter resist that terrible driving beam. For F-1 had discovered a far more efficient release-generator than had the Outsiders. [SNIPPET] They have come here to take over these planets, and have started out with the first, natural moves of any invading life-form. They are destroying the life, the intelligent life particularly, that is here now."" He gave vent to that little chuckle which is the human sign of amusement and pleasure. "" They are destroying the intelligent life—and leaving untouched that which is necessarily their deadliest enemy—the machines. ""You—machines—are far more intelligent than we even now, and capable of changing overnight, capable of infinite adaptation to circumstance; you live as readily on Pluto as on Mercury or Earth. Any place is a home-world to you. You can adapt yourselves to any condition. And—most dangerous to them—you can do it instantly."
1899,"You sleep. Tomorrow—boss talk. Uh!"" So saying, the beast-man curled up at the root of a tree. Parr sat down with his back against another trunk, the club across his knees, but he did not sleep. This, plainly enough, was the outcast horde. It clung together, the gregariousness of humanity not yet winnowed out by degeneration. It had a ruler, too—""Tomorrow boss talk."" [SNIPPET] Parr saw what they meant. With the other community, the newest and therefore most advanced individual ruled. In this more primitive society, the strongest held sway until a stronger displaced him. The giant called Ling was by no means the most human-seeming creature there, but he was plainly the ruler and plainly meant so to continue. Parr was no coward, but he was no fool. As the six-foot bludgeon whirled upward between him and the sky, he cast down his own stick in token of surrender. ""No argument, Ling,"" he said sensibly. There was laughter at that, and silly applause."
1900,"""Ah,"" said Richardson with an edge to his voice, ""the thing for you to do is to tell them that's your star, and they'll have to speak English from now on, so you can understand them. Why, next thing we know, you'll be getting yourself a rocket or a space-ship and going over to that star to set yourself up as king or something."" ""King Thaddeus the First,"" said Alexander loftily. "" All you star-dwellers may kiss the royal foot."" ""That would be unsanitary, I think,"" said McIlvaine, frowning. Poor McIlvaine! They made him the butt of their jests for over an hour before he took himself off to his quarters, where he sat himself down before his telescope and found his star once more, almost huge enough to blot out Arcturus, but not quite, since it was moving away from that amber star now. [SNIPPET] ""McIlvaine, can you hear me?"" McIlvaine started with astonishment. His mental impression of Guru became confused; the voice speaking English came clear as a bell, as if from no distance at all. ""Yes,"" he said hesitantly. ""Well, then, listen to me, listen to Guru. We have now had enough information from you to suit our ends. Within twenty-four hours, we, the inhabitants of Ahli, will begin a war of extermination against Earth...."" ""But, why?"" cried McIlvaine, astounded."
1901,"""A cigarette for me? That would be a very odd thing,"" she said. Then relenting, as she remembered that Olga must be excused for her ignorance, she added: ""You see I never smoke. Never."" ""Oh, you should learn,"" said Olga. "" Now let's play clumps. [SNIPPET] Goosie and I have got beautiful seats, and Mamma is quite close to the piano where she will hear excellently. Has she promised to sing Siegfried? Is Mr Georgie going to play for her? It's the most delicious surprise; how could you be so sly and clever as not to tell anybody?"" Lucia cloaked her rage under the most playful manner, as she ran into the music-room through the hall. ""You naughty things!"" she said. """
1902,"Just come when it damn well suits you."" Paul caught up with him on the trail. "" Look, Ed—"" ""I'll recite it for you: mustn't lose my temper. We mustn't divide; mustn't quarrel; Doc's word is holy at all times—"" ""No one says that."" Spearman wasn't listening. "" Goddamn it, why do you think I've gone away alone so often? To explore, sure, to find things we need. [SNIPPET] The pygmy woman halted fifty feet away in still-faced musing. As Paul had seen through the binoculars, she was elaborately tattooed and young. The pause was long. Dorothy stepped nearer to the place where Wright had left the bones, displaying the locket, her open left hand waving down at her body to demonstrate that she carried no weapons. For the first time Paul realized she had left her holster belt behind."
1903,"And you seem actually happy when I mention it."" ""I'm happy at anything and everything, dear."" ""At the thought of dying too?"" ""Living or dying—it doesn't make any difference. Whatever happens, I'm incapable of being unhappy."" [SNIPPET] I'm the one who blunders. I'm the fool, for arguing with you, when I realize that it's impossible to convince a marak addict."" ""That's it,"" he nodded, and chuckled again. But that wasn't quite it."
1904,"These men will stand no nonsense, and if you insult the captain, even his personal influence could not save you.” Bah! it was hopeless. I slunk back with a feeling of utter helplessness. There was clearly nothing for it but to see the whole hideous affair out in silence. Still, indignation all but mastered me. What ruffians were these anarchists! “ Cowards!” I hissed involuntarily, but by this time they were 128too absorbed in their lot-drawing to hear me. “ [SNIPPET] Here, try again. The view now is splendid.” The glass once more changed hands. “What a sight!” ejaculated my companion, having succeeded in “spotting” the aëronef. “ Why, I can see the whole thing just as if it was only across the road. Just as you described it, too. By the way, there is a solitary individual pacing the fore-deck frantically."
1905,"Only then, belatedly, did the authorities find he was telepathic and agree to let him late in life enter upon the career of pinlighter. He did well at it, but he was fantastically old for this kind of business. Father Moontree looked at the glum Woodley and the musing Underhill. "" How're the youngsters today? [SNIPPET] It's a nuisance being telepathic, he thought. You keep trying to reach even when you are not making contact. Suddenly she swung around on him. ""You pinlighters!"
1906,"Let women once acquire good sense—and if it deserve the name, it will teach them; or, of what use will it be how to employ it.) There would be no end to rules for behaviour, if it be proper always to adopt the tone of the company; for thus, for ever varying the key, a FLAT would often pass for a NATURAL note. Surely it would have been wiser to have advised women to improve themselves till they rose above the fumes of vanity; and then to let the public opinion come round—for where are rules of accommodation to stop? The narrow path of truth and virtue inclines neither to the right nor left, it is a straight-forward business, and they who are earnestly pursuing their road, may bound over many decorous prejudices, without leaving modesty behind. Make the heart clean, and give the head employment, and I will venture to predict that there will be nothing offensive in the behaviour. The air of fashion, which many young people are so eager to attain, always strikes me like the studied attitudes of some modern prints, copied with tasteless servility after the antiques; the soul is left out, and none of the parts are tied together by what may properly be termed character. This varnish of fashion, which seldom sticks very close to sense, may dazzle the weak; but leave nature to itself, and it will seldom disgust the wise. Besides, when a woman has sufficient sense not to pretend to any thing which she does not understand in some degree, there is no need of determining to hide her talents under a bushel. Let things take their natural course, and all will be well. [SNIPPET] What acquirement exalts one being above another? Virtue; we spontaneously reply. For what purpose were the passions implanted? That man by struggling with them might attain a degree of knowledge denied to the brutes: whispers Experience. Consequently the perfection of our nature and capability of happiness, must be estimated by the degree of reason, virtue, and knowledge, that distinguish the individual, and direct the laws which bind society: and that from the exercise of reason, knowledge and virtue naturally flow, is equally undeniable, if mankind be viewed collectively. The rights and duties of man thus simplified, it seems almost impertinent to attempt to illustrate truths that appear so incontrovertible: yet such deeply rooted prejudices have clouded reason, and such spurious qualities have assumed the name of virtues, that it is necessary to pursue the course of reason as it has been perplexed and involved in error, by various adventitious circumstances, comparing the simple axiom with casual deviations. Men, in general, seem to employ their reason to justify prejudices, which they have imbibed, they cannot trace how, rather than to root them out."
1907,"It had taken a dozen of the reserves to club him into submission at the last.  That was too much for Martian justice. In pronouncing sentence the judge had termed Luke an incurably vicious character and a menace to society such as the planet had never harbored. And Luke, his head swathed in bandages from which his wiry red hair bristled like the comb of a gamecock, had grinned evilly and snarled his defiance.  And so they were taking him to the dread prison camp known as Vulcan's Workshop, a mysterious place of horror and hardship from which no convict had ever returned. Vaguely Luke knew that it was located on still another world, away off somewhere in the heavens. He had seen the lips of men go white when they were condemned to its reputed torture, had heard them plead for death in preference. Yet its terrors had not awed him; they did not awe him now. He had beaten the law before; he'd beat it again—even in Vulcan's Workshop. [SNIPPET] Luke was working high up on the slope, with rock drill and pick. The group to which he had been assigned was composed entirely of new prisoners, mostly white men, but with a few blacks and one coppery-skinned drylander of Mars. Whimpering, hopeless creatures, all of them; not worth his notice. All day he labored without speaking to any of them and the quantities of ore he removed gave mute evidence of his tireless vigor. If Kulan, the giant Martian guard, took any notice of it he gave no sign.  During the sleeping period, which they persisted in calling night, things were different. No guards were needed in the escape-proof huts and there was some surreptitious fraternizing among the prisoners."
1908,"Ruiz, watching the radarscope, saw Lubbock slide into focus miles below. Next stop, Fort Worth, he thought. I used to drive that in five hours. The jagged line of the caprock told him they were well on their way to Fort Worth already. [SNIPPET] It's a helluva risk every time you make a shot, in spite of all the propaganda. Hooey; if you didn't know everything's O.K., you wouldn't be getting ready to make the shot. Yeah, but you never can tell——He stopped his inward battle and forced some spring into his step as he moved toward Logan and Ruiz. ""I've tried my best to abort this big bug, but I can't find anything amiss."" ""That's Granny MacNamara for you,"" jibed Logan. "" Always trying to find fault."" He winked at Ruiz and rubbed his hands together. "" Well—tennis, anyone?"""
1909,"All next morning he ruminated over his strange experience. Toward noon the pieces of the puzzle began to fit slowly together in his mind. But the partial answer at which he arrived seemed too fantastic for belief. Could it be possible that when he had stopped at the roadside stand he had blundered, in some inexplicable way, into another dimension? Sutter had a layman's knowledge of Einsteinian physics, and he knew that experiments in Time were being made every day. Only last week he had read in the paper of an army officer who had reportedly Time-traveled some twenty-two minutes. And a year ago the Belgian scientist, Delgar, claimed to have entered a secondary world which he declared impinged on our own. [SNIPPET] Sutter moved the shell slightly so that it lay at directly right angles to the panel of the TV set. Travail, drawing on his cigar, watched him curiously. ""What are you doing?"" he asked at length. ""Little experiment."
1910,"Each of these was closed, or could be closed, by a circular door such as those which concealed the outer entrance to the tunnels, save that these were swung on a side hinge. From the central passage we were following, smaller ones branched off in all directions: to the left, to the right; upward and downward. And all were lined with the cubicles, from which a constantly increasing army of Aranians emerged to accompany us. We had gone but a short distance into the ""city"" when our ancient guide paused, turning to stare down a deserted passage. [SNIPPET] screamed Tipene, shouldering aside the ray men. "" I...."" He disappeared into the slanting shaft, and the two ray men followed quickly. The three members of the crew went next; then Brady and Inverness. Correy and I backed toward the freshly cut passage. ""I'll be right behind you,"" I snapped, ""so keep moving!"" Correy hesitated an instant; I knew he would have preferred the place of danger as the last man, but he was too good an officer to protest when time was so precious. He climbed into the slanting passage the ray had cut for us, and as he did so, I heard, or thought I heard, a cry from beyond him, from one of those ahead. I gave Correy several seconds before I followed; when I did start, I planned on coming fast, for in that shoulder-tight tube I would be utterly at the mercy of any who might attack from behind."
1911,"I have no crystal ball to show me tomorrow. Anyway, even if it works on the miscellaneous growth here I havent the remotest idea how the Grass will react to it. This is only a remote preliminary, as I told you before, and why you encumbered us with your inquisitiveness is more than I can see."" ""Youre coming back tomorrow, then?"" ""Naturally. [SNIPPET] No manures, fuss, cuss, or muss. One shot of the Meta—one shot of Francis' Amazing Discovery and your lawn springs to new life."" ""Lawns? Nonsense!"" she snorted, rudely, I thought. "" Do you think Ive spent years in order to satisfy suburban vanity? Lawns indeed!"" ""Lawns indeed, Miss Francis,"" I retorted with some spirit. "" I'm a salesman and I know something about marketing a product."
1912,"It has bound human beings in a chain, of which one end is life and the other death. If a man reads the 'Mahâbhârata' and has faith in its doctrines, he is free from all sin and ascends to heaven after his death."" The present selection is the episode of Nala and Damayanti. It is one of the most charming of the ""Mahâbhârata"" stories, and its Oriental flavor and delicacy have been well preserved by the translator, Sir Edwin Arnold. L [SNIPPET] with r ].—Too timid maid, here stands the man from w   PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.—You undervalue your own merits, dear Śakoontalá. What man in his senses would intercept with the skirt of his robe the bright rays of the autumnal moon, which alone can allay the fever of his body? ŚAKOONTALÁ [smiling].—Then it seems I must do as I am bid. [ Sits down and appears to be thinking.] KING.—How charming she looks! My very eyes forget to wink, jealous of losing even for an instant a sight so enchanting."
1913,"""George,"" Miss Doody shrilled, her sharp pencil raised, ""did you or did you not tell me to go to hell?"" Charlie crashed through the crowd, waving a telegram. "" Look at this, George!""

1914,"You must have played very softly."" I would tell a thousand more lies worse than that one to see the look of relief that came into her face. She smiled adorably, and said in her natural voice: ""Alec, I tripped on that wolf's head, and I think my ankle is sprained. Please call Marie, and then go home."" I did as she bade me, and left her there when the maid came in. [SNIPPET] The Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the Surgeon-General. I heard him say: ""The laws prohibiting suicide and providing punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been repealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through physical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community will be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since the passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has not increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a Lethal Chamber in every city, town and village in the country, it remains to be seen whether or not that class of human creatures from whose desponding ranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily will accept the relief thus provided."" He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber."
1915,"You've got connections higher up. If I could only get a chance to transfer to Ag Culture, go on one of those farms as a worker—"" Frazer shook his head. "" Sorry, Harry. You know the situation there, I'm sure. Right now there's roughly ninety million approved applications on file. [SNIPPET] That was murder, too. But it was a fast, cheap meal, easy to prepare, and the ingredients didn't waste a lot of storage space. The only trouble was, he hated the way they tasted. Harry wished he had time to eat his breakfasts in a restaurant. He could afford the price, but he couldn't afford to wait in line more than a half-hour or so. His office schedule at the agency started promptly at ten-thirty. And he didn't get out until three-thirty; it was a long, hard five-hour day. Sometimes he wished he worked in the New Philly area, where a four-hour day was the rule. But he supposed that wouldn't mean any real saving in time, because he'd have to live further out."
1916,"But that was relatively easy. The third temptation turned out to be infinitely harder. Little Charlie, aged five, owned a dog, a grave, sober, studious dog named Oscar. On a morning near the end of Mr. Jell's second year, Oscar was run over by a truck. And Charlie gathered the dog up, all crumpled and bleeding and already dead, and carried him tearfully but faithfully off to Mr. Jell, who could fix anything. And Mr. Jell could certainly have fixed Oscar. Hoping to guard against just such an accident, he had already made a ""recording"" of Oscar several months before. The Box had scanned Oscar and discovered exactly how he was made—for the Box, as has been said, could duplicate anything—and Mr. Jell had only to dial Oscar number to produce a new Oscar. [SNIPPET] Mr. Jell admired this property, too, but he could make no use of it. For once he had dialed, he would also be billed. And of course his Box would be traced to Earth. That Mr. Jell could not allow. No, he would make do with whatever was available on Earth. He had to get along without the catalogue."
1917,"Why, of course, dear Badger! What is my pleasure or convenience compared with that of others! You wish it done, and it shall be done. Go, Badger, order the Banquet, order what you like; then join our young friends outside in their innocent mirth, oblivious of me and my cares and toils. I sacrifice this fair morning on the altar of duty and friendship!”  The Badger looked at him very suspiciously, but Toad’s frank, open countenance made it difficult to suggest any unworthy motive in this change of attitude. [SNIPPET] I shall lead a quiet, steady, respectable life, pottering about my property, and improving it, and doing a little landscape gardening at times. There will always be a bit of dinner for my friends when they come to see me; and I shall keep a pony-chaise to jog about the country in, just as I used to in the good old days, before I got restless, and wanted to do things.”  “Stroll quietly down to Toad Hall?” cried the Rat, greatly excited. “ What are you talking about? Do you mean to say you haven’t heard?”  “Heard what?” said Toad, turning rather pale. “"
1918,"says he. “ It seems a strange thing to ask a gift again, but I own I am laith to cut another.”  I gave him the button; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his great-coat which he had used to bind the cross; and tying in a little sprig of birch and another of fir, he looked upon his work with satisfaction.  “Now,” said he, “there is a little clachan” (what is called a hamlet in the English) “not very far from Corrynakiegh, and it has the name of Koalisnacoan. There there are living many friends of mine whom I could trust with my life, and some that I am no just so sure of. [SNIPPET] I told him I would listen closely. My chest was tight, my mouth dry, the light dark to my eyes; the thought of the numbers that were soon to leap in upon us kept my heart in a flutter: and the sea, which I heard washing round the brig, and where I thought my dead body would be cast ere morning, ran in my mind strangely.  “First of all,” said he, “how many are against us?”  I reckoned them up; and such was the hurry of my mind, I had to cast the numbers twice. “ Fifteen,” said I  Alan whistled. “ Well,” said he, “that can’t be cured. And now follow me."
1919,"""Why is he wearing a mask?"" Wurpz quips. ""You are as funny as a plutonium crutch,"" Zahooli says. ""No hard feelin's,"" Wurpz says, and takes a small flask out of his pocket. "" We will drink to Operation Earthworm."" [SNIPPET] The purple light flashes on, and I count to three. Just as the blast of air loaded with XYB plus cuts loose I throw all the bug powder left in the box into the current. Hitler Number Three breathes in a big gob of it and buckles a little at the knees. ""Grab him!"" I screech. "" Don't let him yank that disintegrator loose. Hit him with anything you see, pals!"" I see the other beetleheads collapse like they had been hit with bulldozers and I know now that insecticide is more dangerous in Subterro than all the radioactivity harnessed up on six planets."
1920,"I regret very much having to announce that this vicarion of the production Spies from Space was defective. The multifilm has broken and, because of the complexity of the vikie process, it will be impossible to splice it without returning it to the laboratory. ""Ushers are at the exits with passes good for any future performance. Those of you who prefer can exchange them at the box office for a full refund of your admission price."" Paul Asher unstrapped the wired canvas band from across his chest. He put the selectorscope spectacles into the pouch on the arm of the seat and walked out of the R.K.O. Vicarion into High Street and around the corner to where his car was parked. His roommate at the communapt, MacCloy, was still up when he got there, going over some projectos. [SNIPPET] You seem to know who I am."" ""That I do,"" she said. ""Then why don't you call me by my name, instead of 'Sweetheart'?"" ""That's because I like you, Sweetheart."" She was looking out the rear window. "" Now just step on the gas, because we've got company."""
1921,"We sped toward it, cutting the purple sea into white foam. Slafe was in the bow, customarily taciturn, the crew were busy. Alone on board I had no immediate occupation and so I took out my copy of the Intelligencer and after reading the column which went under my name and noting the incredible bad taste which had diluted when it had not excluded everything I had written, I turned as for consolation to the marketquotations. The Dow-Jones average was down again, as might be expected since the spread of the weed had unsettled the delicate balance of the stockmarket. My eyes automatically ran down the column and over to the corner where stocks were quoted in cents to reassure my faith in Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates. There it was, immovable through any storm or stress or injudicious investment by Albert Weener, ""CP&AC ... 1/16."" I must have raised my eyes from the newspaper just about the time the fog lifted. Before us, like the smokewreath accompanying the discharge of some giant cannon, the green mass volleyed into the sea. It did not slope gently like a beach[146] or offer a rugged shoulder to be gnawed away as a rocky cliff, but thundered forward into the surging brine, yielding but invincible, a landforce potent as the wave itself. [SNIPPET] Organize a sales campaign; rationalize production. Put the whole thing on a commercial basis. For all this you need a man who has contacted the public on every level—preferably doortodoor and with a varied background."" She strode past the stove, which had gathered new accreta during the night and looked in the cloudy mirror as though searching for a misplaced thought. "" No doubt, Weener, no doubt."
1922,"Clarisse Bader, author of a somewhat remarkable book on the position of women in ancient Indian society. Almost simultaneously this volume fell into the hands of Toru, and she was moved to translate it into English, for the use of Hindoos less instructed than herself. In January, 1877, she accordingly wrote to Mlle. Bader requesting her authorization, and received a prompt and kind reply. On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to this, her solitary correspondent in the world of European literature, and her letter, which has been preserved, shows that she had already descended into the valley of the shadow of death:— These simple and pathetic words, in which the dying poetess pours out her heart to the one friend she had, and that one gained too late, seem as touching and as beautiful as any strain of Marceline Valmore's immortal verse. In English poetry I do not remember anything that exactly parallels their resigned melancholy. Before the month of March was over, Toru had taken to her bed. Unable to write, she continued to read, strewing her sick-room with the latest European books, and entering with interest into the questions raised by the Société Asiatique of Paris, in its printed Transactions. [SNIPPET] He related that the Vulture had advised his Sovereign to summon Night-cloud, the Crow, and learn from him regarding King Silver-sides' intentions. Night-cloud attended accordingly. 'Crow!' asked King Jewel-plume, 'what sort of a Monarch is the Rajah Silver-sides?' 'Truthful, may it please you,' replied the Crow; 'and therewithal noble as Yudisthira himself.' 'And his Minister, the Goose?' 'Is a Minister unrivalled, my Liege,' said the Crow-king. 'But how then didst thou so easily deceive them?' 'Ah!"
1923,"It was very fascinating, and I and that old man set to work amongst the gravels, and, to be brief, in half an hour found enough glittering stuff to set up a Fifth Avenue jeweller's shop. But to tell the truth, now that I had breakfasted, and felt manhood in my veins again, I was eager to be off, and out of the close, death-tainted atmosphere of that valley. Consequently I presently stood up and said—  ""Look here, old man, this is fine sport no doubt, but just at present I have a big job on hand—one which will not wait, and I must be going. See, luck and young eyes have favoured me; here is twice as much gold and stones as you have got together—it is all yours without a question if you will show me the way out of this den and afterwards put me on the road to your big city, for thither I am bound with an errand to your king, Ar-hap.""  The sight of my gems, backed, perhaps, with the mention of Ar-hap's name, appealed to the old fellow; and after a grunt or two about ""losing a tide"" just when spoil was so abundant, he accepted the bargain, shouldered his belongings, and led me towards the far corner of the beach.  It looked as if we were walking right against the towering ice wall, but when we were within a yard or two of it a narrow cleft, only eighteen inches wide, and wonderfully masked by an ice column, showed to the left, and into this we squeezed ourselves, the entrance by which we had come appearing to close up instantly we had gone a pace or two, so perfectly did the ice walls match each other. [SNIPPET] It was threadbare enough to all conscience in places, yet the design still lived in solemn, age-wasted hues, and, as I dragged it to my stove-front and spread it out, it seemed to me that it was as much like a star map done by a scribe who had lately recovered from delirium tremens as anything else. In the centre appeared a round such as might be taken for the sun, while here and there, ""in the field,"" as heralds say, were lesser orbs which from their size and position could represent smaller worlds circling about it. Between these orbs were dotted lines and arrow-heads of the oldest form pointing in all directions, while all the intervening spaces were filled up with woven characters half-way in appearance between Runes and Cryptic-Sanskrit. Round the borders these characters ran into a wild maze, a perfect jungle of an alphabet through which none but a wizard could have forced a way in search of meaning.  Altogether, I thought as I kicked it out straight upon my floor, it was a strange and not unhandsome article of furniture—it would do nicely for the mess-room on the Carolina, and if any representatives of yonder poor old fellow turned up tomorrow, why, I would give them a couple of dollars for it. Little did I guess how dear it would be at any price!  Meanwhile that steak was late, and now that the temporary excitement of the evening was wearing off I fell dull again."
1924,"Curiosity overcame the desire to straighten out her clothes. Entering a wide passage, they turned to the right. It ended abruptly in a room with several comfortable chairs. Three tables occupied the center in uneven positions, the underparts filled with metal-covered books. [SNIPPET] It isn't what you have done, but what you want to do, that interests me."" He spoke with a strange accent, that Dick didn't recognize. But he was pleasant and made it easy to talk. When Barrow finished, by relating the finding of the newspaper and the long walk to the office, the queer man was smiling. ""I like your frankness and will tell you about the position, although I can't reveal the location of your work. It is not on any map, and you will work among a race such as myself, with no opportunity of leaving after reaching the destination."
1925,"To fill the lengthening void, he asked. ""What did you think of the little test I gave this morning?"" ""It was all right,"" Donald said. ""You both did pretty well; I'm proud of you."" ""We had everything right,"" David pointed out without a flicker of expression. Elvin couldn't seem to engineer the dialogue as he used to. [SNIPPET] ""Do you know what it is, Gary?"" ""It's one of those gas burners you have on the lab tables in—"" ""The metal, I mean."" ""Looks like gold. Aren't these rather expensive for a high school classroom?"" She sagged against the wall, running her trembling fingers over her thin lips. """
1926,"What force? What army?"" ""No army,"" I said. "" You might call me a teacher; my corps is made up of teachers. We give lessons—where lessons are needed."" ""A teacher,"" he said quietly. A long time passed. "" Well,"" he asked, ""do I pass the course?"" ""You pass,"" I told him. "" [SNIPPET] Now, you wait a minute,"" he said. "" And don't touch that box. We've got some talking to do."" ""Such as?"" ""Such as how you managed to get here from Ancarta, and why,"" he said. """
1927,"""Ah!… So you've still got that ridiculous idea in your head?"" ""If you mean,"" said Oleron slowly, ""that I've discarded the old Romilly, and am at work on a new one, you're right. I have still got that idea in my head."" Something uncordial in his tone struck her; but she was a fighter. His own absurd sensitiveness hardened her. She gave a ""Pshaw!"" [SNIPPET] I had asked sorrowfully. I had been on the point of repeating my name but suddenly, after holding my eyes for a moment with a look the profundity and familiarity of which I cannot express, he had broken into the most ghastly haunting laugh I have ever heard. ""Harrison?"" the words had broken throatily from him…. "" Oh yes; I know you!… You shall very soon know that I know you if… if…"" The cough and rattle had come as Maschka had rushed into the room. In ten seconds Andriaovsky had fallen back, dead. That same evening I began to make notes for Andriaovsky's ""Life."""
1928,"Spatial Housing Authority requires them every 12 feet but sometimes they come in handy, especially with certain guests.

1929,"For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles. But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.  The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat of the day, chilled me through my jacket. [SNIPPET] “My dear,” said my mother suddenly, “take the money and run on. I am going to faint.”  This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it. So there we had to stay—my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn."
1930,"Are you sure the people at the spaceport have not made some mistake? That is more or less the direction I came from."" The pilot stared impatiently at the papers thrust under his nose. ""Can't say, sir. We have our work cut out just to take the ship to where they tell us. Only reason we carry passengers is that regulations require cooperation with the Agency. [SNIPPET] Carole waved jauntily. She took Winstead by the elbow. ""That was Wilfie,"" she explained. "" We'll be getting married if we can ever get our job shifts straightened out. I hope I didn't make him late, poor boy—it was his only chance to see me until tomorrow."" Winstead was hardly aware of having been steered into an elevator. When they reached the second floor, Carole led him a few steps along the hall."

1932,"The Laplanders and the Samoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the Mediterranean. Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions will not be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now, may not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable and animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new continent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these insects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all these things, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our globe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of new continents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages, a Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the Himalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia, and Europe. Then these new continents will become, in their turn, uninhabitable; heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when the soul has left it; and life will disappear from the globe, if not for ever, at least for a period. Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest—will be left to death—to revive some day under superior conditions! But all that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and beginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be carried too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.  “My dear Cyrus,” replied Spilett, “these theories are prophecies to me, and they will be accomplished some day.” [SNIPPET] At the northern extremity of the bay the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve. There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great banks of sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then returned towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the snow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles. From its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the presence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of this forest to the shore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees."
1933,"Fortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of the eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be considered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there are still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the Oklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real estate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political scene. But this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile when the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even the tremendous price the country paid for its new sea—fourteen million dead, untold property destroyed—really offsets the asset we enjoy today. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the world, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade and the ferment of world culture. It would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last century to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation walking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen miles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as world ports and great manufacturing centers. [SNIPPET] The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping 2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The ""Memphis Tilt"" is today one of the unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but during the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed. South and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma. By morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves advanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests forming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the thirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge. Washington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the wild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land rose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma."
1934,"""It's Tuesday,"" Staghorn said. Then both were silent because at that moment a child appeared, a boy of about eleven. He burst from the schoolhouse door and ran across the cracked asphalt toward the playground, glancing back over his shoulder as though expecting pursuit. Reaching the play apparatus he paused and looked around desperately. The metal standards for the swings were in place but no swings hung from them. [SNIPPET] ""I can't tell you! They might punish me!"" Staghorn shook her heartily, ignoring the fact that she was over fifty. "" Tell me! It so happens that besides Paul, they've captured Dr. Clarence Peccary, and I'm responsible for his life!"" At this statement Miss Terry let out a cry of horror. "" They've caught Dr. Peccary?"
1935,"He was looking toward the bow, but on hearing the subdued clink of metal on metal, he turned. A dozen of the pirates were coming toward him. It would have been useless to draw his weapon. Theirs were out and could have burned him to a crisp before he could move. Silently and with deadliness apparent in every move they approached him. [SNIPPET] And Gore would murder no more. Stupidly, he let Sorko slide to the floor, where the poor fellow recovered sufficiently from his paralyzing fright and his fall to scuttle away. Looking past the menacing weapon, Gore saw the girl, Lenore Hyde. Her limpid eyes under their straight brows were blazing, and he read in them certain death for himself. ""Up that ladder!"" she ordered sharply, ""and stay out! Guard, when this beast is gone I will give you this weapon."
1936,"George stopped their caravan and the two men got out, stretching their legs. They looked about, both more interested in the dig, now they were back at it, than setting up camp. They walked around, examining various parts of it, and the excitement of the promise of things to be discovered in the earth came to them. "" This summer we'll learn the answer,"" Sidney predicted. With skeptical hope George replied, ""Maybe."" [SNIPPET] George glanced at the dent in the side panel of the station wagon. "" It's still there,"" he agreed. "" But only to tell us this wasn't a dream. No one else would believe it wasn't caused by a rock."" George groaned. He stared at the rise of ground behind which the Indians had disappeared. "" Huk,"" he pleaded. "" Good Fox."
1937,"These—the keg and canisters—I connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation.  “Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. [SNIPPET] “At five o’clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely. I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever."
1938,"This, in the pursuit of her object, the Gy readily promises; and as the characteristic of this extraordinary people is an implicit veneration for truth, and her word once given is never broken even by the giddiest Gy, the conditions stipulated for are religiously observed. In fact, notwithstanding all their abstract rights and powers, the Gy-ei are the most amiable, conciliatory, and submissive wives I have ever seen even in the happiest households above ground. It is an aphorism among them, that “where a Gy loves it is her pleasure to obey.” It will be observed that in the relationship of the sexes I have spoken only of marriage, for such is the moral perfection to which this community has attained, that any illicit connection is as little possible amongst them as it would be to a couple of linnets during the time they agree to live in pairs.    Nothing had more perplexed me in seeking to reconcile my sense to the existence of regions extending below the surface of the earth, and habitable by beings, if dissimilar from, still, in all material points of organism, akin to those in the upper world, than the contradiction thus presented to the doctrine in which, I believe, most geologists and philosophers concur—viz., that though with us the sun is the great source of heat, yet the deeper we go beneath the crust of the earth, the greater is the increasing heat, being, it is said, found in the ratio of a degree for every foot, commencing from fifty feet below the surface. But though the domains of the tribe I speak of were, on the higher ground, so comparatively near to the surface, that I could account for a temperature, therein, suitable to organic life, yet even the ravines and valleys of that realm were much less hot than philosophers would deem possible at such a depth—certainly not warmer than the south of France, or at least of Italy. [SNIPPET] Believe that here my friendship speaks, and that my jealousy is silent.”  With these words Zee left me. And recalling those words, I thought no more of succeeding to the throne of the Vril-ya, or of the political, social, and moral reforms I should institute in the capacity of Absolute Sovereign.    After the conversation with Zee just recorded, I fell into a profound melancholy."
1939,"None was forthcoming from among my men, and against their protest I insisted on being lowered into the shaft. When I was a few metres from the bottom the cable parted and I fell and lay stunned on the floor below. When I recovered consciousness the light had gone out. There was no sound about me. [SNIPPET] How is it,"" asked Hellar, ""that you speak German?"" By way of answer I addressed him in English and in French, while he and Zimmern glanced at each other as do men who see a miracle and strive to hold their reason while their senses contradict their logic. I now sketched the story of my life and adventures with a fulness of convincing detail. One incident only I omitted and that was of the near discovery of my identity by Armstadt's former mistress. Of that I did not speak for I felt that Marguerite, at least in the presence of the others, would not relish that part of the story. Nor did I wish to worry them with the fear that was still upon me that I had not seen the last of that affair."
1940,"""What does the thermometer say?"" ""Twenty-seven, six tenths (82° Fahr.)."" ""Therefore the savants are wrong by 2,705°, and the proportional increase is a mistake. Therefore Humphry Davy was right, and I am not wrong in following him. What do you say now?"" [SNIPPET] This calculation could, at best, be but a vague approximation; but a learned man is always a philosopher when he succeeds in remaining cool, and assuredly Professor Liedenbrock possessed this quality to a surprising degree. I could hear him murmuring geological terms. I could understand them, and in spite of myself I felt interested in this last geological study. ""Eruptive granite,"" he was saying. "" We are still in the primitive period. But we are going up, up, higher still."
1941,"You'd only bruise yourself. A stone is neither cruel nor tender. You've married a man of stone, Sally. He hasn't missed a day at the office in eight years. She'd never visited the office but he was always there to answer when she phoned. "" I'm very busy, Sally. What did you say? You've bought a new hat? [SNIPPET] It did Sally no good to clutch frantically at his arm as he fell, to tug and jerk at the slackening folds of his suit. The heaviness of his descending bulk dragged him down and away from her, the awful inertia of lifeless flesh. He thudded to the floor and rolled over on his back, seeming to shrink as Sally widened her eyes upon him. He lay in a grotesque sprawl at her feet, his jaw hanging open on the gaping black orifice of his mouth . Sally might have screamed and gone right on screaming—if she had been a different kind of woman. On seeing her husband lying dead her impulse might have been to throw herself down beside him, give way to her grief in a wild fit of sobbing. But where there was no grief there could be no sobbing . One thing only she did before she left. She unloosed the collar of the unmoving form on the floor and looked for the small brown mole she did not really expect to find."
1942,"Joshua shivered and said, ""We're through, Myra."" ""Through? I don't understand."" ""The Moon trip. I can't swing it. The money's run out. There's no place I can raise another dime."" ""But you've worked so hard—and so long! [SNIPPET] ""It's far more than that, Lee. You'll find the plans sound."" Lee Gorman didn't give a tinker's hoot for the plans. He was only enjoying an interview—a vengeance—he was loath to terminate. "" You haven't even begun to show me what I'd need before I even considered loaning you a dime."" ""I'll bring you anything you want."""
1943,"It had moved. The sun shone obliquely, throwing Stinson's shadow upon the sand. The wind devil also had a shadow, although the sun shone through it and the shadow was faint. But it moved when the funnel moved. This was no illusion. [SNIPPET] What business is it of yours if she lives or dies? My race discarded such primitive logic long before it reached your level of development."" ""Yes,"" Stinson said, ""and your race no longer exists."" The Sand God became a sphere of blue flame. A wave of intense heat drove them backward. """
1944,"As these preparations were nearing completion I sent for Dr. Zimmern and Col. Hellar to meet me at my apartment. ""Comrades,"" I said, ""you have endangered your own lives by confiding in me your secret desires to overthrow the rule of the House of Hohenzollern as it was overthrown once before. You have done this because you believed that I would have power that others do not have."" The two old men nodded in grave assent. ""And you have been quite fortunate in your choice,"" I concluded, ""for not only have I pledged myself to your ends, but I shall soon possess the coveted power. In a few days I shall demonstrate my process on a large scale before the Chemical Staff. But I shall do this thing without revealing the method. [SNIPPET] It must be a strange mixture of blood-lines that could produce such wondrous beauty. In no other woman have I seen such a blackness of hair and eyes combined with such a whiteness of skin. I suppose I should not have danced with her--now I see all my resolutions shattered. But I think it was most of all the blackness of her eyes. Well, what care, we live but once!"" I read and re-read this entry and searched feverishly in Armstadt's diary for further evidence of a personal life. But I only found tedious notes on his chemical theories. Perhaps this single reference to a woman was but a passing fancy of a man otherwise engrossed in his science. But if rescuers came and I succeeded in passing for the German chemist the presence of a woman in my new rôle of life would surely undo all my effort."
1945,"We entered, and found that a hut had been assigned to each of us. These huts were superior to any that we had yet seen, and in each was a most comfortable bed made of tanned skins, spread upon mattresses of aromatic grass. Food too was ready for us, and so soon as we had washed ourselves with water, which stood ready in earthenware jars, some young women of handsome appearance brought us roasted meats, and mealie cobs daintily served on wooden platters, and presented them to us with deep obeisances.  We ate and drank, and then, the beds having been all moved into one hut by our request, a precaution at which the amiable young ladies smiled, we flung ourselves down to sleep, thoroughly wearied with our long journey.  When we woke it was to find the sun high in the heavens, and the female attendants, who did not seem to be troubled by any false shame, already standing inside the hut, having been ordered to attend and help us to “make ready.”  “Make ready, indeed,” growled Good; “when one has only a flannel shirt and a pair of boots, that does not take long. I wish you would ask them for my trousers, Quatermain.” [SNIPPET] Poor fellow, poor fellow! So it has all been for nothing. God’s will be done.”  “Now for business,” I put in, anxious to escape from a painful subject. “"
1946,"They were almost in orbit, now, climbing at a slight angle with a velocity sufficient to carry them around Earth forever, a streamlined, tiny satellite. After the first few moments of disorientation, rocket crews found that a weightless condition gave them, ambiguously, a buoyant feeling. Only the doughnut crew had really adapted to this condition, living as they did without the effects of gravity for hours at a time every day. The temporary ""housing"" was rotated for comfort of the crews during rest periods, but while moving the plates and girders of the giant doughnut into place, they had no such luxuries. [SNIPPET] An hour and over a hundred and fifty feet later, MacNamara wheezed as he swung over the bulkhead at the base of Valier's third and top stage. His aching limbs persuaded him to take a breather. After all, his complete inspection of the day before really made a final preflight unnecessary, and passing near the frigid oxygen tanks was a day's work in itself. He listened to the innumerable noises around and below him. The clicks and hums near him meant that Ruiz, having given up following him, was checking out the flight controls, with power on only in the top stage. From below came a vibrational rushing noise, nearly subsonic, which told him of the fueling operation."
1947,"BOTH THE HERMITS [approaching].—Victory to the King! KING [rising from his seat].—Hail to you both! BOTH THE HERMITS.—Heaven bless your Majesty! [They offer fruits.   KING [respectfully receiving the offering].—Tell me, I pray you, the object of your visit. [SNIPPET] KING.—I am all attention. HERMITS [extending their hands].—Victory to the King! KING.—Accept my respectful greeting. HERMITS.—May the desires of your soul be accomplished!"
1948,"Now the method of growing wise, learned, and sublime having become so regular an affair, and so established in all its forms, the number of writers must needs have increased accordingly, and to a pitch that has made it of absolute necessity for them to interfere continually with each other. Besides, it is reckoned that there is not at this present a sufficient quantity of new matter left in Nature to furnish and adorn any one particular subject to the extent of a volume. This I am told by a very skilful computer, who hath given a full demonstration of it from rules of arithmetic. This perhaps may be objected against by those who maintain the infinity of matter, and therefore will not allow that any species of it can be exhausted. For answer to which, let us examine the noblest branch of modern wit or invention planted and cultivated by the present age, and which of all others hath borne the most and the fairest fruit. For though some remains of it were left us by the ancients, yet have not any of those, as I remember, been translated or compiled into systems for modern use. Therefore we may affirm, to our own honour, that it has in some sort been both invented and brought to a perfection by the same hands. What I mean is, that highly celebrated talent among the modern wits of deducing similitudes, allusions, and applications, very surprising, agreeable, and apposite, from the signs of either sex, together with their proper uses. And truly, having observed how little invention bears any vogue besides what is derived into these channels, I have sometimes had a thought that the happy genius of our age and country was prophetically held forth by that ancient typical description of the Indian pigmies whose stature did not exceed above two feet, sed quorum pudenda crassa, et ad talos usque pertingentia. [SNIPPET] By what I have gathered out of ancient records, I find the compass of their doctrine took in two-and-thirty points, wherein it would be tedious to be very particular. However, a few of their most important precepts deducible from it are by no means to be omitted; among which, the following maxim was of much weight: That since wind had the master share as well as operation in every compound, by consequence those beings must be of chief excellence wherein that primordium appears most prominently to abound, and therefore man is in highest perfection of all created things, as having, by the great bounty of philosophers, been endued with three distinct animas or winds, to which the sage Æolists, with much liberality, have added a fourth, of equal necessity as well as ornament with the other three, by this quartum principium taking in the four corners of the world. Which gave occasion to that renowned cabalist Bombastus [119a] of placing the body of man in due position to the four cardinal points. In consequence of this, their next principle was that man brings with him into the world a peculiar portion or grain of wind, which may be called a quinta essentia extracted from the other four. This quintessence is of catholic use upon all emergencies of life, is improveable into all arts and sciences, and may be wonderfully refined as well as enlarged by certain methods in education. This, when blown up to its perfection, ought not to be covetously boarded up, stifled, or hid under a bushel, but freely communicated to mankind. Upon these reasons, and others of equal weight, the wise Æolists affirm the gift of belching to be the noblest act of a rational creature. To cultivate which art, and render it more serviceable to mankind, they made use of several methods."
1949,"This tears it. This ties it up in a box with a bloody ribbon-bow. I suppose you know what this means—what I've got to do now?"" ""Spin ship,"" she replied immediately, and looked up at him pertly, like a kindergarten child who knows she has the right answer. He groaned. ""You said you could do it."" [SNIPPET] It doesn't want to turn. Any force that tries to make it turn is resisted at right angles to the force applied. When that force is applied momentarily from jets, as they swing into position and away again, the firing formulas get—well, complex. And the ship's course and landing approach are completely new. Instead of letting the ship fall to the Moon, turning over and approaching tail-first with the main jets as brakes, Captain McHenry is going to have to start the spin first and go almost the whole way nose-first. He'll come up on the Moon obliquely, pass it, stop the spin, turn over once to check the speed of the ship, and once again to put the tail down when the Moon's gravity begins to draw us in. There'll be two short periods of free-fall there, but they won't be long enough to bother you much. And if we can do all that with the fuel we've got, it will be a miracle."
1950,"A journeyman who works by the piece is likely to be industrious, because he derives a benefit from every exertion of his industry. An apprentice is likely to be idle, and almost always is so, because he has no immediate interest to be otherwise. In the inferior employments, the sweets of labour consist altogether in the recompence of labour. They who are soonest in a condition to enjoy the sweets of it, are likely soonest to conceive a relish for it, and to acquire the early habit of industry. A young man naturally conceives an aversion to labour, when for a long time he receives no benefit from it. The boys who are put out apprentices from public charities are generally bound for more than the usual number of years, and they generally turn out very idle and worthless. [SNIPPET] He must have made, therefore, by each course of lectures, a thousand minae, or £ 3335:6:8. A thousand minae, accordingly, is said by Plutarch, in another place, to have been his didactron, or usual price of teaching. Many other eminent teachers in those times appear to have acquired great fortunes. Georgias made a present to the temple of Delphi of his own statue in solid gold. We must not, I presume, suppose that it was as large as the life. His way of living, as well as that of Hippias and Protagoras, two other eminent teachers of those times, is represented by Plato as splendid, even to ostentation. Plato himself is said to have lived with a good deal of magnificence."
1951,"I advise all of you who have not yet attended the Solaris Museum on Jupiter, to take a trip there some Sunday afternoon. The Interplanetary Suburban Line runs trains every half hour on that day. You will find there a complete working model of the old satellite of the Earth, which, before it was destroyed, furnished this planet light at night through the crude medium of reflection. ""On account of this decision as to the inadvisability of allowing the moon to remain where it was, engineers commenced its removal in the year 2721. Piece by piece, it was chipped away and brought to the Earth in Interplanetary freight cars. These pieces were then propelled by Zoodolite explosive, in the direction of the Milky Way, with a velocity of 11,217 meters per second. [SNIPPET] What did he do? ""He proceeded to one of these banks, known at that time as 'The First National Bank of Chicago,' and deposited there, one of these disks—a silver Dollar—to the credit of a certain individual. And this individual to whose credit the Dollar was deposited was no other person than the fortieth descendant of John Jones who stipulated in paper which was placed in the files of the bank, that the descendancy was to take place along the oldest child of each of the generations which would constitute his posterity. ""The bank accepted the Dollar under that understanding, together with another condition imposed by this John Jones, namely, that the interest was to be compounded annually. That meant that at the close of each year, the bank was to credit the account of John Jones's fortieth descendant with three one-hundredths of the account as it stood at the beginning of the year. ""History tells us little more concerning this John Jones—only that he died in the year 1931, or ten years afterward, leaving several children. ""Now you gentlemen who are taking mathematics under Professor L127M72421Male, of the University of Mars, will remember that where any number such as X, in passing through a progressive cycle of change, grows at the end of that cycle by a proportion p, then the value of the original X, after n cycles, becomes X(1 + p)n. ""Obviously, in this case, X equalled one Dollar; p equalled three one-hundredths; and n will depend upon any number of years which we care to consider, following the date of deposit. By a simple calculation, those of you who are today mentally alert can check up the results that I shall set forth in my lecture."
1952,"Because artists draw things vanishing to points, does that mean that they really vanish?"" A wack, that's what he was. Nice guy, but sorta screwy. He kept saying more goofy things while he was finishing up the machine, about how he'd figured out that all we knew about vision and drawing and so on must be wrong, and that once he got a look at the real world he'd prove it. ""How about cameras?"" I asked him. "" Take a picture with a camera and it looks just about the same as a drawing, don't it?"" ""That's because cameras are built to take pictures like we're used to seeing them,"" he said. "" Flat, two-dimensional slices of reality, without depth or motion."" [SNIPPET] Yeh, kind of a crackpot, Carter was. Just on that one subject, though; nice enough guy otherwise. Here, look at some of the drawings he made, working out his formulas. Nice designs, huh? Might make good wall paper or fabric patterns."
1953,"Sira dived in, unhesitatingly, and after an easy underwater swim she emerged in the open canal. There was a considerable swell, for there was a slight breeze blowing from the north across twenty miles of water, but this did not distress Sira at all. She undulated through the waves with perfect comfort. Phobos was just rising in the west, and orientating herself by this tiny moon she struck out in a north-easterly direction, seeking a favorable current to carry her toward Tarog. Early explorers on Mars were astonished to find that the canals were not stagnant bodies of water, but possessed currents, induced by wind, by evaporation, and the influx of fresh water from the polar ice caps. This was near the equator, however, and the water was not unreasonably cold, although the night air was, as usual, chilly. [SNIPPET] He could see only that he seemed to be dressed in white desert trousers and blouse, and that he wore a broad-brimmed sun helmet. He was carrying something in a bag over his shoulder. He was making the difficult ascent with practiced ease, his body thrown well forward, making fast time for such an apparently deliberate gait. The desert glare hurt Murray's eyes. He closed them and fell asleep."
1954,"He shook a warning forefinger. "" I will now resume my talk."" ""A moment ago, gentlemen, I mentioned the John Jones Dollar. Some of you who have just enrolled with the class will undoubtedly say to yourselves: 'What is a John Jones? [SNIPPET] He wrote: ""In the following century, many minor changes, of course, took place in man's mode of living; but the so-called socialists still agitated widely for the cessation of private ownership of wealth; the First National Bank still accepted Dollars for safe keeping, and the John Jones Dollar still continued to grow. With about thirty-four generations yet to come, the account now stood: ""And by the end of the succeeding hundred years, it had grown to what constituted an appreciable bit of exchange value in those days—thus:"
1955,"I found that no genius in another could please me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort.—GOLDSMITH.  One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect. In spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia, and the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James, Mr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him, and was spiritually a-hungered like the rest of us. He had done nothing exceptional in marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and considers an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. [SNIPPET] “Ah! you are a happy fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, turning on his heel and beginning to fill his pipe. “ You don’t know what it is to want spiritual tobacco—bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a variety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of Philomicron, for the ‘Twaddler’s Magazine;’ or a learned treatise on the entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not mentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage through the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon, showing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern research. You don’t mind my fumigating you?”  Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its implied meaning—that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the right vocation. The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History, made him think again of the winnings at cards and their destination. But he was beginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one. The Vicar’s frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but simply the relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible."
1956,"The rays of the machine caught it and brought it back with us; made it solid matter, as we know it here. Do you recognize it?” I nodded, shuddering. There was no possibility of mistake. In a squat, clear bottle of alcohol that Vic had taken from the drawer was a sinister, claw-like brown hand, severed cleanly at the wrist. [SNIPPET] She just got the key and went in. After a few minutes I heard something buzzing in there, and I thought maybe Mr. Butler was showing her some new gadget of his, like he was always doing. Then there was a telephone call for him, and I couldn’t make neither of them answer; that’s when Mr. Perrin and I began to get worried.” “I see.”"
1957,"He flung himself in, breathing heavily and fumbling to drop a coin in the slot, pulled the control lever all the way over. Twenty minutes later, the Starduster hovered for a moment over Aurora, then shimmered and vanished as it went into subspace. OCTOBER 2, 435th Year GALACTIC E The Starduster materialized just outside the atmosphere of the planet Elysia, and fluttered erratically downward, like a wounded bird. [SNIPPET] As the biophysicist went out the door, the Director looked down once more at the pile of papers before him. He pulled the top sheet closer, and rubber-stamped across its face—CASE CLOSED. ""Yes,"" he mused aloud. "" Closed for us, but—"" He hesitated a moment, and then sighing once more, signed his name in the space provided."
1958,"Camari leaned back for a short pause. His eyes looked beseechingly at his unseen audience. His voice softened. ""That was the past and, admittedly, a poor foundation upon which to build; let us now look to a more positive future. [SNIPPET] On the other hand, revisions to treaties and to our positions at the negotiating tables may be essential. Slingshot may solve our disagreements, but we cannot wait. ""Review our readiness and activation sequences consistent with our Quick Reaction Capability to deal with contingencies in the Slingshot Special Zone. Work up details on what needs to be done and by whom to upgrade our QRC initiatives for each contingency that I keyed in as probable. Show costs in still accessible resources separately and integrate results with relevant commitments and schedules. Draft implementation plans and execution directives to commit resources."
1959,"That’s why I’ve sent for a detective—— (Jobbins enters, hat in hand and umbrella under arm; he is a stout man, rather shabbily dressed in tweed, with tweed frock-coat, and has a square-topped bowler.) Jobbins. My name is Jobbins, sir. ( Gives large card.) Private inquiry and detective agent, utmost secrecy and despatch, parties watched, missing relatives traced, divorces ensured. Jack. [SNIPPET] Jack. No one remembers what happened before they were born. Walter (bangs a book down on table). Oh, damned nonsense!"
1960,"And I may tell you that by now he had got through fully half his money.) Two or three days later he went to see the President of the Commission again. ‘ I should be glad to know,’ he said, ‘whether by now you can do anything for me in return for my having shed my blood and suffered sickness and wounds on military service.’ ‘ First of all,’ said the President, ‘I must tell you that nothing can be decided in your case without the authority of the Supreme Government. Without that sanction we cannot move in the matter. Surely you see how things stand until the army shall have returned from the war? All that I can advise you to do is wait for the Minister to return, and, in the meanwhile, to have patience. Rest assured that then you will not be overlooked. [SNIPPET] But those boots split within a fortnight, and brought down upon your head dire showers of maledictions; with the result that gradually your shop grew empty of customers, and you fell to roaming the streets and exclaiming, ‘The world is a very poor place indeed! A Russian cannot make a living for German competition.’ Well, well! ‘ Elizabeta Vorobei!’ But that is a WOMAN’S name! How comes SHE to be on the list? That villain Sobakevitch must have sneaked her in without my knowing it.”"
1961,"She wanted to show me other things she had brought, and flew to the table where she had left a sort of satchel an inch and a half long—quite a load for her to fly with, but the translucent substance is so light that when she rested the satchel on my finger I scarcely felt it. She arranged a few articles eagerly for my inspection, and I put the glass to work again. One was a jeweled comb; she ran it through the down on her chest and legs to show me its use. There was a set of tools too small for the glass to interpret them; I learned later they were a sewing kit. A book, and some writing instrument much like a metal pencil. [SNIPPET] The answer was: ""No. He is sorry. He is ill and cannot live long. I am to see him in a few days, when I fly a little better. He taught me for twenty years after I was born."" ""I don't understand."
1962,"I'm going nuts."" ""No you're not. You're slugging the thing inside you that wants to quit. Slashaway, I'm going to give the crew a first-class pep talk. There'll be no stampeding while I'm in command here."" [SNIPPET] He crawled now toward the prone gym slugger on his hands and knees, his temples thudding. The gyrations ceased an instant before he reached Slashaway's side. With an effort he lifted the big man up, propped him against the bulkhead and shook him until his teeth rattled. "" Slashaway,"" he muttered. "" Slashaway, old fellow."""
1963,"A guinea, I mean.  —I get paid this morning, Stephen said.  —The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? [SNIPPET] Let her wait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too."
1964,"He watched, horrified, as the tool slowly cartwheeled away into space. ""All right,"" he muttered, ""scratch one splice tool. It was also my only pair of pliers, but I'll manage."" He knew he could use the wire cutters in a pinch. "" In a pinch,"" he repeated. "" [SNIPPET] The altimeter showed slightly over forty-two miles when stage two detached itself. Logan, in constant contact with White Sands, was informed that they were tracking perfectly as Valier arrowed over central Texas toward rendezvous at the doughnut. The exhausted lower stages were forgotten now; only the second stage was of any concern anyway. The radar boys tracked it all the way down, ready to detonate it high in the air if its huge 'chutes wafted it near any inhabited community. The motors of stage three blasted for a carefully calculated few seconds, then cut out automatically. With the destitution of his weight, Mac felt his spirits soar also. They were almost in orbit, now, climbing at a slight angle with a velocity sufficient to carry them around Earth forever, a streamlined, tiny satellite. After the first few moments of disorientation, rocket crews found that a weightless condition gave them, ambiguously, a buoyant feeling."
1965,"I seem to have heard the name. Or seen it somewhere—"" Pat beamed upon her companionably. Stepping to my desk, he up-ended the typewriter and pointed to a legend in tiny letters stamped into the frame: Reg. U.S. Pat. Off.—Pat. [SNIPPET] What would be the probable odds?"" ""High,"" she replied, ""Very high. Perhaps as high as forty to one."" ""In that case,"" I decided, ""it's not only ethical, it's a moral obligation. If you're opposed to gambling, Pat, what better way can you think of to put the parimutuels out of business?"" ""And besides,"" Sandy pointed out, ""this would be a wonderful opportunity to display your new discovery before an audience of thousands. Well, Pat?"
1966,"Drake stretched himself out. When his breathing showed him fast asleep indeed, I slipped over to the black eunuch and crouched, right hand close to the butt of my automatic, facing him.    “Yuruk,” I whispered, “you love us as the wheat field loves the hail; we are as welcome to you as the death cord to the condemned. Lo, a door opened into a land of unpleasant dreams you thought sealed, and we came through. [SNIPPET] It raised within me a half sick revulsion, loathing. But the eyes were not ancient, no. Irisless, lashless, black and brilliant, they blazed out of the face's carven web of wrinkles, intent upon Norhala and filled with a flame of worship.  It threw itself at her feet, prostrate, the inordinately long arms outstretched.  “Mistress!” it whined in a high and curiously unpleasant falsetto. “"
1967,"Ken's changed his mind, Nora says. Ken doesn't like the academy. She says he wants to go to medical school."" Old Donegal thought it over, nodded absently. "" That's fine. Space-medics get good pay."" [SNIPPET] You never sleep enough. Are you afraid I'll get up and run away if you go to sleep for a while?"" She managed a brittle smile. "" There'll be plenty of time for sleep when ... when you're well again."" The brittle smile fled and she swallowed hard, like swallowing a fish-bone. He glanced down, and noticed that she was squeezing his hand spasmodically. There wasn't much left of the hand, he thought."
1968,"Before the Separation it was a plain of burnt grass smothered in clouds of dust, with an ox-cart track to our Jetty. Nothing more. This is the Harbour Gate. Picturesque, is it not? Formerly the town stopped short there. We enter now the Calle de la Constitucion. Observe the old Spanish houses. Great dignity. [SNIPPET] Montero and his brother made the subject of an earnest talk between the Dictator-President and the Nestor-inspirer of the party. But Don Vincente, a doctor of philosophy from the Cordova University, seemed to have an exaggerated respect for military ability, whose mysteriousness—since it appeared to be altogether independent of intellect—imposed upon his imagination. The victor of Rio Seco was a popular hero. His services were so recent that the President-Dictator quailed before the obvious charge of political ingratitude. Great regenerating transactions were being initiated—the fresh loan, a new railway line, a vast colonization scheme. Anything that could unsettle the public opinion in the capital was to be avoided. Don Jose bowed to these arguments and tried to dismiss from his mind the gold-laced portent in boots, and with a sabre, made meaningless now at last, he hoped, in the new order of things.  Less than six months after the President-Dictator’s visit, Sulaco learned with stupefaction of the military revolt in the name of national honour. The Minister of War, in a barrack-square allocution to the officers of the artillery regiment he had been inspecting, had declared the national honour sold to foreigners."
1969,"No more. Half pressure. He squeezed. The room leaped around him. [SNIPPET] Conger looked out. "" Where are we? What is this place?"" The hand of the guard pressed into his arm. "" Come. Through that door."" Conger stepped down, onto the damp sidewalk."
1970,"Fine. The Good Book says a little wine is good for a man, or something like that. I don't remember exactly."" Of course he didn't, Infield knew. Why should he? [SNIPPET] He sat down on Morgan's desk. "" That's just one thing, the gyro ball. There are so many others, so many."" Morgan smiled. "" You know, Henry, not all of our Cures are so—so—not all are like that. Those Cures for mother complexes aren't even obvious. If anybody does see that button in a patient's ear, it looks like a hearing aid."
1971,"No one knew what his fault had been; his master had simply taken a dislike to him. A guard was set that no one should relieve the miserable being. Felix's horror and indignation could not have been expressed, but he was totally helpless. His own condition of mind during this time was such as could not be well analysed. [SNIPPET] If the shepherds left their circle they were easily ridden over; while they maintained formation they lost individuals, but saved the mass. Battles were of rare occurrence; the gipsies watched for opportunities and executed raids, the shepherds retaliated, and thus the endless war continued. The shepherds invariably posted sentinels, and sent forward scouts to ascertain if the way were clear. Accustomed to the horrid scenes of war from childhood, they could not understand Felix's sensitiveness. They laughed, and then petted him like a spoilt child. This galled him exceedingly; he felt humiliated, and eager to reassert his manhood. He was willing to stay with them there for awhile, nothing would have induced him to leave them now till he had vindicated himself in their sight. The incident happened soon after sunrise, which is very early at the end of June."
1972,"Been a lush for three years because I've been scared for three years. Been scared for three years because three years ago I saw a machine beat a man at a game of chess."" A machine that plays chess? That was interesting, I said. [SNIPPET] What's more, it doesn't even have to look like a brain or fit into the tiny space occupied by a real brain. It can be housed in a six-story building and look like an overgrown typewriter or an automobile dashboard or even a pogo stick. All it has to do is tell you that two times two equals four, and tell you fast. When you're told to build an artificial leg that'll take the place of a real one, the headaches begin. Your machine must not only look like its living model, it must also balance and support, walk, run, hop, skip, jump, etc., etc. Also, it must fit into the same space. Also, it must feel everything a real leg feels—touch, heat, cold, pain, moisture, kinesthetic sensations—as well as execute all the brain-directed movements that a real leg can. So you're not duplicating this or that function; you're reconstructing the organ in its totality, or trying to."
1973,"And now for the first time, at a depth of hundreds of yards, I did at last encounter living men. My first thought was that I had gone back to the day of the cave-man, for a cave-like hollow had been scooped out in the solid rock. It was true that the few hundreds of people huddled together there had the dress and looks of moderns; it was true, also, that the gloom was lighted for them by electric bulbs, and that electric radiators kept them warm; yet Dante himself, in painting the ninth circle of his Inferno, could not have imagined a drearier and more despondent group than these that slouched and drooped and muttered in that cavernous recess, seated with their heads fallen low upon their knees, or moodily pacing back and forth like captives who can hope for no escape. "" Here at least we will be safe from the sky marauders,"" I heard one of them muttering. Yet I could not help wondering what the mere safety of the body could mean when all the glories of man's civilization were annihilated. There came a whirring in my head, and another blank interval; and when I regained my senses I knew that another period of time had passed, possibly months or even years. I stood on the palisade above the river, near the entrance of the caves; and the sun was bright above me; but there was no brightness in the men and women that trailed out of a small circular hole in the ground. Drab as dock-rats, and pasty pale of countenance as hospital inmates, and with bent backs and dirty, tattered clothes and a mouse-like nosing manner, they emerged with the wariness of hunted refugees; and they flung up their hands with low cries to shield them from the brilliance of the sun, to which they were evidently unaccustomed. From the packs on their backs and the bundles in their hands, I knew that they were emerging from their subterranean refuge, to try to begin a new life in the ravaged world above; and my heart went out to them, for I saw that, few as they were—not more than fifty in all—they were the sole survivors of a once-populous region, and would have a bitter fight to wage in the man-made wilderness that had been a world metropolis. [SNIPPET] Then through the sides of the enormous ball—I would not say, through the door, for nothing of the kind was visible—a glorious being emerged, followed by several of his kind. He was shaped like a man, and was no taller than a man, and yet there was that about him which said that he was greater than a man, for light seemed to pour from every cell of his body, and a golden halo was about his head, and his eyes shot forth golden beams so intense and so magnetic that, once having observed them, I could hardly take my gaze away. With slow steps he advanced, motioning the people to him; and they drew near, and flung themselves before him on the ground, and cried out in adoration. And I too threw myself to earth, in worship of this superhuman creature; and I heard the words he spoke, and with some deeper sense I translated them, though they were not uttered in any language I knew:"
1974,"Keep me informed."" John Davis Drumstetter stayed beside his huge mind machine for nearly a week, and, though he was only sixty, he looked like an old man when he greeted Monica and Norcross at the end of that time. ""The relay is finished,"" he announced. "" It's being installed in the Last Hope now. [SNIPPET] ""Experiments that must be kept secret,"" mumbled Norcross. ""And it is my belief,"" said the young man in a clipped, cold voice, ""that you have sold yourself to your taste buds and digestive tract. Either that,"" and here his burning rage came into the open, ""or you are a pseudo-life!"" At this ultimate insult, Scientist Norcross was silent with indignation. He watched Drumstetter shrug into a stole, turn down the power to the huge mind machine, sling his reticule over his shoulder, and stalk off through the hedge."
1975,"The surface of the planet appears to be remarkably level, and it has no mountain ranges. No evidences of volcanic action have been discovered on Mars. The dusky and reddish areas were regarded by the early observers as respectively seas and lands, but at present it is not believed that there are any bodies of water on the planet. There has never been much doubt expressed that the white areas about the poles represent snow.  It will be seen from this brief description that many remarkable resemblances exist between Mars and the earth, and there is nothing wonderful in the fact that the question of the habitability of the former has become one of extreme and wide-spread interest, giving rise to the most diverse views, to many extraordinary speculations, and sometimes to regrettably heated controversy. The first champion of the habitability of Mars was Sir William Herschel, although even before his time the idea had been suggested. He was convinced by the revelations of his telescopes, continually increasing in power, that Mars was more like the earth than any other planet. [SNIPPET] The interest excited by the Aurora in scientific circles was greatly stimulated when, in the last half of the nineteenth century, it was discovered that it is a phenomenon intimately associated with disturbances on the sun. The ancient “Zurich Chronicles,” extending from the year 1000 to the year 1800, in which both sun-spots visible to the naked eye and great displays of the auroral lights were recorded, first set Rudolf Wolf on the track of this discovery. The first notable proof of the suspected connection was furnished with dramatic emphasis by an occurrence which happened on September 1, 1859. Near noon on that day two intensely brilliant points suddenly broke out in a group of sun-spots which were under observation by Mr R. C. Carrington at his observatory at Redhill, England. The points remained visible for not more than five minutes, during which interval they moved thirty-five thousand miles across the solar disk. Mr R. Hodgson happened to see the same phenomenon at his observatory at Highgate, and thus all possibility of deception was removed. But neither of the startled observers could have anticipated what was to follow, and, indeed, it was an occurrence which has never been precisely duplicated."
1976,"His bed-room and dressing-room were at the side of the gallery, directly opposite to my father's, which had a sort of ante-room en suite, in which were some of his theological books. The day after Mr. Bryerly's arrival, I was about to see whether my father's water caraffe and glass had been duly laid on the table in this ante-room, and in doubt whether he was there, I knocked at the door. I suppose they were too intent on other matters to hear, but receiving no answer, I entered the room. My father was sitting in his chair, with his coat and waistcoat off, Mr. Bryerly kneeling on a stool beside him, rather facing him, his black scratch wig leaning close to my father's grizzled hair. There was a large tome of their divinity lore, I suppose, open on the table close by. The lank black figure of Mr. Bryerly stood up, and he concealed something quickly in the breast of his coat.

1977,"Tell me about them."" ""Well, they are—cars, you might say, with wheels that go into the body when you take off. They can do, oh, 5,000 miles an hour in the ionosphere, 50 miles up."" ""Fifty miles,"" Maitland mused. "" Then they're sealed tight, so the air doesn't leak out?"" [SNIPPET] His face felt hot and swollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps. The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his eyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at him for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was starting to ache from the effort of blinking. ""What year is this?"" he asked."
1978,"A suppressed cheer greeted his words and the Earthmen crowded around him, vibrant with excitement. ""The time is at hand!"" cried a stern-faced man in the crimson robe which marked him an Akildare, an under-officer of the Earthmen. ""Before I can operate a space flyer, I will have to have one to operate,"" objected Damis. ""That will be supplied,"" cried a dozen voices. Turgan's voice rose above the hubbub of sound. ""Let us proceed in orderly fashion,"" he cried. The noise died down to silence and at a gesture from their ruler, the Earthmen took seats. [SNIPPET] Undaunted by the fate of their leaders, the balance of the mob surged forward uttering cries of hate and rage. From all the doorways, fresh hordes of Earthmen came rushing to join the fray. Again and again the terrible rays of the Jovian guards blasted scores of their assailants into nothingness but more came. Presently the tubes of the Jovians began to lose their power and the violet light became lighter in shade."
1979,"""We will, of course, make every effort to bring back his ... remains ... so that he can have a fitting burial on Earth."" ""No,"" she said. ""I beg your pardon, ma'am?"" She raised her eyes to the patch of sky where her son had passed in his shining metal sarcophagus. [SNIPPET] It must be wonderful being a star mother, Martha."" ("" Yes, it is—in a way."") Wonderful ... and terrible. If only he can last it out for a few more hours, she thought."
1980,"I ran on, holding my cudgel in my hand. Suddenly a horse came towards me. A man was on it, leaning over his shoulder.  “Are you cooked too, Krafstein?” he cried.  There was no answer.  I sprang to the horse’s head. It was Rupert Hentzau. [SNIPPET] “Rassendyll,” interrupted Fritz, getting down from the table and taking my arm, “look here.”  The King lay full length on the floor. His face was red as his hair, and he breathed heavily. Sapt, the disrespectful old dog, kicked him sharply. He did not stir, nor was there any break in his breathing. I saw that his face and head were wet with water, as were mine."
1981,"It was in my coat. There was no reason for me to feel I needed it. But I did. If there was any truth to the story of a ""zip"" knocking out the boys—and I had all five of them right there for evidence—I had the unpleasant conviction that there was real trouble circulating around East Harlem that afternoon. ""Champ. They all waking up!"" [SNIPPET] As I was about to speak, however, he said suddenly: ""Let's rove, man."" And all five of them walked quickly away a few ""yards."" It was quite disappointing. I observed them conferring among themselves, glancing at me, and for a time proposed terminating my venture, for I then believed that it would be better to return ""home,"" as you say, in order to more adequately research the matter. However, the five young men came toward me again. The one who had spoken before, who I now detected was somewhat taller and fatter than the others, spoke as follows: ""You're wanting the Mafia?"" I agreed. He looked at me for a moment. "" Are you holding?"""
1982,"He had stopped reading newspapers and magazines too, had exiled himself to a few city blocks. And as the years flowed by, that self exile had become a prison, an intangible, impassable wall bounded by four city blocks by three. Beyond them lay utter, unexplainable terror. Beyond them he never went. But recluse though he was, he could not on occasion escape from hearing things. Things the newsboy shouted on the streets, things the men talked about on the drugstore corner when they didn't see him coming. And so he knew that this was the year 1960 and that the wars in Europe and Asia had flamed to an end to be followed by a terrible plague, a plague that even now was sweeping through country after country like wild fire, decimating populations. A plague undoubtedly induced by hunger and privation and the miseries of war. But those things he put away as items far removed from his own small world. [SNIPPET] Scant years after he had written those prophetic words the thing was happening. Man had played unwittingly into the hands of those other minds in the other dimension. Man had waged a war and war had bred a pestilence. And the whole vast cycle of events was but a detail of a cyclopean plan."
1983,"the captain asked. ""No. Not after a radiation dosage like that."" He looked down at Pendray. "" His problem was easy, mathematically. But not psychologically. That took real guts to solve."" [SNIPPET] His problem was easy, mathematically. But not psychologically. That took real guts to solve."" ""Yeah,"" said the captain gently. "" All he had to do was get here alive. The problem said nothing about his staying that way."""
1984,"They reach a level of excellence rare even at this day; the artists have evidently been in thorough sympathy with the author, and have given to the eye what the latter has presented to the understanding. A more lovable divinity than that which confronts us on the golden throne it has seldom been our fortune to behold; and the designs of animal-plants are as remarkable as anything in modern illustrative art: they are entirely unique, and possess a value quite apart from their artistic grace. The chief complaint I find to urge against the book is that it stops long before my curiosity regarding the contents of the interior world is satisfied. There are several continents and islands yet to be heard from. But I am reassured by the termination of the story that there is nothing to prevent the hero from continuing his explorations; and I shall welcome the volume which contains the further points of his extraordinary and commendable enterprise. Julian Hawthorne. [13] [SNIPPET] I'm glad to know, sorr, I haven't lost me entire constitution at all evints, an' if I can only carry home what weight I've got lift I'll make a fortune in a dime museum."" As the Polar King sped southward over the interior sea the wonders of the strange world we had discovered began to dawn upon us. The colossal vault rose more and more above us and the sun threw his mild and vertical rays directly upon ship and sea, producing a most delightful climate. The ocean had a temperature of 75 degrees Fahr. and the air 85 degrees."
1985,"But somehow the Earthmen had won through, and eager eyes searched the little glade. Hilary exhaled sharply. The Vagabond, stanch and faithful companion of all his travels, rested immovably on the deep green grass. It had escaped the questing eyes of the Mercutians. [SNIPPET] ""Exactly."" Joan shuddered, convulsively. "" No, no,"" she cried aloud in her terror, ""don't do that. I'll tell you everything; I'll do—"" ""Joan,"" Hilary interrupted sharply, ""not another word."" His arm went around her. She collapsed against his shoulder, sobbing. ""It is too late for bargains now,"" the Viceroy shrugged indifferently. "" We have the man we wanted."
1986,"I have many on file in the Neuropsychiatorium. Just go and take your pick. However, I will give you one ad lib and sub rosa. There is more downstairs than Professor Zalpha dreams about. Who is he to say there is no civilization in inner space as well as outer? [SNIPPET] They are elastic waves sent out through the body of the Earth, huh? Their observed times of transmission give a means of finding their velocities of propagation at great depths. I read that in a book that should be in the Terra-firmament Institute along with the Spirit of St. Louis."" Septimus Spink walked out at this point, surrounded by Interplanetary scribes, one of whom was Exmud R. Zmorro. Spink informed the Fourteenth Estate that he would let them have a gander at the model of his inner space machine in due time. He inferred that one of his financial backers in the fabulous enterprise was Aquintax Djupont, and that the fact that Djupont had recently been brain-washed at the Neuropsychiatorium in Metropolita had no bearing on the case whatsoever. I am seeing and listening to that news item right now which has been repeated a dozen times the last twenty-four hours as if nobody could believe it. I am Septimus Spink, and descended from a long line of Spinks that began somewhere back at the time they put up the pyramids."
1987,"I won’t stop to describe it now, for it will be better that you see it for yourself and enjoy it all fresh as I did. The Castle is an immense place. You had better ship off, as soon as all is ready here and you can arrange it, the servants whom I engaged; and I am not sure that we shall not want as many more. There has hardly been a mop or broom on the place for centuries, and I doubt if it ever had a thorough good cleaning all over since it was built. And, do you know, Uncle, that it might be well to double that little army of yours that you are arranging for Rupert? [SNIPPET] “I walked, sir, because I had no money; but I assure you I did not mean to be insolent. I simply came here because I wished to ask your advice and assistance, not because you are an important person, and have a long avenue—as I know to my cost—but simply because you are one of my trustees.” “Your trustees, sirrah!” said my father, interrupting him. “"
1988,"She is responsible only to the Aërial Board of Control—the A. B. C. of which Tim speaks so flippantly. But that semi-elected, semi-nominated body of a few score persons of both sexes, controls this planet. "" Transportation is Civilization,"" our motto runs. Theoretically, we do what we please so long as we do not interfere with the traffic and all it implies. [SNIPPET] G. P. O. inflators are thrice as thick as a racing man's ""flickers,"" and chafe abominably under the armpits. George takes the wheel until Tim has blown himself up to the extreme of rotundity. If you kicked him off the c. p. to the deck he would bounce back. But it is ""162"" that will do the kicking. ""The Mark Boat's mad—stark ravin' crazy,"" he snorts, returning to command. "" She says there's a bad blow-out ahead and wants me to pull over to Greenland. I'll see her pithed first! We wasted an hour and a quarter over that dead duck down under, and now I'm expected to go rubbin' my back all round the Pole. What does she think a postal packet's made of?"
1989,"Some say of this civic employment of mine (and I am willing to say a word or two about it, not that it is worth so much, but to give an account of my manners in such things), that I have behaved myself in it as a man who is too supine and of a languid temperament; and they have some colour for what they say. I endeavoured to keep my mind and my thoughts in repose;  and if they sometimes lash out upon some rude and sensible impression, ‘tis in truth without my advice. Yet from this natural heaviness of mine, men ought not to conclude a total inability in me (for want of care and want of sense are two very different things), and much less any unkindness or ingratitude towards that corporation who employed the utmost means they had in their power to oblige me, both before they knew me and after; and they did much more for me in choosing me anew than in conferring that honour upon me at first. I wish them all imaginable good; and assuredly had occasion been, there is nothing I would have spared for their service; I did for them as I would have done for myself. ‘ [SNIPPET] They being come, he ties a rope to one of the arms of the prisoner, of which, at a distance, out of his reach, he holds the one end himself, and gives to the friend he loves best the other arm to hold after the same manner; which being. done, they two, in the presence of all the assembly, despatch him with their swords. After that, they roast him, eat him amongst them, and send some chops to their absent friends. They do not do this, as some think, for nourishment, as the Scythians anciently did, but as a representation of an extreme revenge; as will appear by this: that having observed the Portuguese, who were in league with their enemies, to inflict another sort of death upon any of them they took prisoners, which was to set them up to the girdle in the earth, to shoot at the remaining part till it was stuck full of arrows, and then to hang them, they thought those people of the other world (as being men who had sown the knowledge of a great many vices amongst their neighbours, and who were much greater masters in all sorts of mischief than they) did not exercise this sort of revenge without a meaning, and that it must needs be more painful than theirs, they began to leave their old way, and to follow this. I am not sorry that we should here take notice of the barbarous horror of so cruel an action, but that, seeing so clearly into their faults, we should be so blind to our own. I conceive there is more barbarity in eating a man alive, than when he is dead; in tearing a body limb from limb by racks and torments, that is yet in perfect sense; in roasting it by degrees; in causing it to be bitten and worried by dogs and swine (as we have not only read, but lately seen, not amongst inveterate and mortal enemies, but among neighbours and fellow-citizens, and, which is worse, under colour of piety and religion), than to roast and eat him after he is dead."
1990,"""Our scouting party saw the same thing happen. That's why we moved in. It's about over now. We'll know a lot more about them and where they came from in twenty-four hours."" They had nothing further to say. The military man regarded them thoughtfully. "" I don't know about you three. [SNIPPET] When he got to the next corner he noticed that the traffic signals were not working. Black, empty eyes. His pace quickened. He walked faster—ever faster until he was trotting on the brittle pavement, his sharp steps echoing against the buildings. Faster."
1991,"""I had better go home, don't you think?"" I asked. ""Hanged if I know,"" he replied frankly. While we were discussing the advisability of my departure Geneviève reappeared in the doorway without her bonnet. She was wonderfully beautiful, but her colour was too deep and her lovely eyes were too bright. She came straight up to me and took my arm. [SNIPPET] The square had become very silent. The last homeless loiterer had been driven away by the grey-coated park policeman, the car tracks along Wooster Street were deserted, and the only sound which broke the stillness was the stamping of the sentry's horse and the ring of his sabre against the saddle pommel. In the barracks, the officers' quarters were still lighted, and military servants passed and repassed before the bay windows. Twelve o'clock sounded from the new spire of St. Francis Xavier, and at the last stroke of the sad-toned bell a figure passed through the wicket beside the portcullis, returned the salute of the sentry, and crossing the street entered the square and advanced toward the Benedick apartment house. ""Louis,"" I called. The man pivoted on his spurred heels and came straight toward me. ""Is that you, Hildred?"""
1992,"He reeled and had trouble keeping from falling to his left when he did arrive at its top. Nevertheless he did not pause to catch breath or balance but pulled the lever that would make the door swing out. He burst through it. No one there, thank God. He stopped for a moment, listened to make sure nobody was in the next room, then pushed on a boss set in a pattern of bronze protuberances, which was connected with the mechanism that operated the secret door. [SNIPPET] At the moment Amra was strangely quiet and meek. All she would say was that she had many business connections and that she knew well Zingaro, the Thieves' Guild Business Agent. They had been childhood playmates, and they'd helped each other in various shady transactions since. It was only natural that she should hear about the exurotr a slave hiding on the Bird of Fortune had given Zingaro to take back to the Duke. Cornering Zingaro, she had worked out of him enough information to be sure that Green had escaped to the 'roller. After all, Zingaro was under oath only to be reticent about certain details of the whole matter. From there she had taken the business into her own hands, had told Miran that she would inform the Duchess of Green's whereabouts unless he permitted her and her family to go along on the voyage. ""Here I am, your faithful and loyal wife,"" she said, opening her arms in an expansive gesture. ""I am overwhelmed with emotion,"" replied Green, for once not exaggerating."
1993,"I think they would seem like pretty nice monsters if they weren't so alien to us that neither side can really understand the other. They use the cosmic energies too, but in a different way—and their way interferes with ours just as ours interferes with theirs. Different brains, you see. ""Anyway, it was decided that the two civilizations would get along best by just staying away from each other. If they divided up the Galaxy between them, there would be no interference; it would be too far from one civilization to the other. The Hulduvians were, really, very nice about it. They're willing to take the outer rim, even if there are fewer stars, and let us have the center. ""So by the agreement, we've got to have all men and manlike beings out of their territory before they come to settle it, just as they'll move out of ours. [SNIPPET] ""It must be a strange life,"" said Kormt. "" Belonging to no one."" They came out on the market-square, a broad paved space walled in by houses. There was a fountain in its middle, and a statue dug out of the ruins had been placed there. It was broken, one arm gone—but still the white slim figure of the dancing girl stood with youth and laughter, forever under the sky of Earth. Jorun knew that lovers were wont to meet here, and briefly, irrationally, he wondered how lonely the girl would be in all the millions of years to come. The City Hall lay at the farther end of the square, big and dark, its eaves carved with dragons, and the gables topped with wing-spreading birds. It was an old building; nobody knew how many generations of men had gathered here."
1994,"He was silent. That blue-white infinitesimal up there growing slowly—the oneness, the calm rapture of Being in a universe that you shaded into without harsh discontinua, the being one with the great blue-white gem-flower blossoming now in the heavens that were no different stuff than you yourself— He closed his eyes, calm, and meditated on Connectivity. He was being Good. By the time the fusion reaction had covered the whole small disk of the sunlet, a quarter-hour at the most, his meditation began to wear off. Tropile shrugged out of his torn parka, not bothering to rip it further. It was already growing warm in the room. [SNIPPET] He stirred, and added another datum: I appear also to be in a tank of fluid and yet I do not drown. There were certain deductions to be made from that. Either someone—the Pyramids?—had done something to his lungs, or else the fluid was as good an oxygenating medium as air. Or both. Suddenly a burst of data-lights twinkled on the board below him. Instantly and involuntarily, his sixteen hands began working the switches, transmitting complex directions in a lightninglike stream of on-off clicks. Tropile relaxed and let it happen. He had no choice; the power that made it right to respond to the board made it impossible for his brain to concentrate while the response was going on."
1995,"Why did he feel every day less akin to the men with whom he had shared the voyage? He had had wit enough to keep his semirebellion under cover, but since he had taken the flitter into the morning sky above the landing place of the spacer, that task of self-discipline was becoming more and more difficult. ""Did you notice,"" the com-tech said, going off on a new track, ""that these painted boys were not too quick about blasting along to their strongbox? I'd say that they thought some bright rocket jockey might have rigged a surprise for them somewhere in there—"" Now that Soriki mentioned it, Raf remembered that the alien party who had gone into the city had huddled together, and that several of the black-and-white warriors had fanned out ahead as scouts might in enemy territory. ""They didn't go any farther than that building to the west either."" [SNIPPET] So, they had made it—half of their venture was accomplished. They had broken out of their own solar system, made the big jump, and before them lay the unknown. Now it was within their reach. ""D'you hear that, kid?"" demanded Wonstead, his voice no longer an accusing whine, more steady than Raf ever remembered hearing it. "" We got through!"
1996,"Domestic tranquillity, shall we say?” He was smiling now; he had everything in control. “So that’s your purpose?” Rynason said. There was anger in his voice, feigned or real—perhaps both. But his voice rose still higher. “ Is butchery your only goal in life, Manning?” Manning stepped toward him again, his eyes narrowing. “ Butchery? [SNIPPET] There were three of them, two men and what looked like a boy still in his teens. The boy had red hair and a dark, ruddy complexion: he was new to the outworlds. The two older men had the pallor of the Edge drifters, nurtured in the artificial light of spacers and sealed survival quarters on the less hospitable worlds. The larger of the two men had a knife, a heavy blade of a type that was common out here; many of the men used them as hatchets when necessary. This one dripped with blood; the smaller man’s left arm was torn open just below the shoulder, and hanging uselessly. He stood swaying in the dust, hurling a string of curses at the man with the knife, while the boy stood slightly behind him, staring with both fear and hatred in his eyes. He had a smaller knife, but he held it loosely and uncertainly at his side."
1997,"“Larsborg said the same thing,” Mara interjected. “Larsborg said he’d have his report ready in a couple of days anyway!” “I’ll give you what I’ve got as soon as I can,” Rynason said. “ But things are just beginning to break for me—did you see my note this afternoon?” “Yes, of course. The part about this Tedron or whatever his name was?” [SNIPPET] “Can you remember the actual communication?” Horng’s head tilted to one side in a peculiarly strained fashion; Rynason could see a muscle jumping where the alien’s neck blended with his torso. THE MEMORIES ARE BURIED SO DEEPLY. I CANNOT REACH THEM. Rynason gazed pensively at the interpreter as these words were recorded. What could have happened during that conversation that would have caused its memory to be so deeply buried? “Can you find among any of the rest of Tebron’s memories any thoughts about Kor?” YES. TEBRON HAD MEMORIES THAT HE HAD COMMUNICATED WITH KOR, BUT THESE ARE FLEETING."
1998,"We’ll need plenty of both.” “Have you ever worked with him?” I asked. “No. Are you worried?” “Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.” The Major laughed. “ I don’t think we need to worry about McIvers. [SNIPPET] Keep your head, but crowd your luck a little, okay?” “I’ll try,” I said. It was asking the impossible and Mikuta knew it. We were on a long downward slope that shifted and buckled all around us, as though there were a molten underlay beneath the crust; the slope was broken by huge crevasses, partly covered with dust and zinc sheeting, like a vast glacier of stone and metal. The outside temperature registered 547° F. and getting hotter. It was no place to start rushing ahead. I tried it anyway."
2000,"""But there are many other such writers. You can't control—"" ""We control ninety percent of the output. We have concentrated on the field and all of the science-fiction agencies are in our hands. This control was imperative."" [SNIPPET] The Coroner was disappointed. A lunatic. But a lunatic can murder. Best to proceed, the Coroner thought. "" I was not aware that we have Martians to contend with."" ""If I'd had the right weapon to use on Smith, you wouldn't be aware of it now. We still exercise caution."""
2001,"""I know."" ""You've got to help me."" His voice was urgent, pleading. He brushed past her, into her room. She walked in after him, shut and locked the door, leaned her back against it. ""You can't stay here,"" she said. ""Are you alone?"" [SNIPPET] ""Shut up!"" Lazar snapped. ""Your word is good, isn't it, Lazar?"" Lynn said."
2002,"The machine knew better. There were still many ways to kill an enemy. Time-tested ways. There were armies fighting in four continents, armies that had marched overland, or splashed ashore from the sea, or dropped out of the skies. Incredibly, the war went on. When the tanks ran out of gas, and the flame throwers became useless, and even the prosaic artillery pieces had no more rounds to fire, there were still simple guns and even simpler bayonets and swords. [SNIPPET] ""And you have neither resigned nor cracked up."" General LeRoy nodded. "" I called you in."" Before the CIA man could comment, Ford said, ""The computer's right inside this doorway. Let's get this over with while the building is still empty."""
2003,"""There was a scandal, and he deserted her; and afterward—only last week—she ran away, nobody knows where, but they think to Boston."" It was about two o'clock in the afternoon when Henry heard the fate of Madeline. By four o'clock he was on his way back to Boston. The expression of his face as he sits in the car is not that which might be expected under the circumstances. It is not that of a man crushed by a hopeless calamity, but rather of one sorely stricken indeed, but still resolute, supported by some strong determination which is not without hope. Before leaving Newville he called on Mrs. Brand, who still lived in the same house. [SNIPPET] At his answer her face flushed with pleasure, and she replied shyly— ""If you'd like to, you may."" Henry was not in the least a conceited fellow, but it was impossible that he should not understand the reason why Ida, who all the morning had looked forlorn enough, was now the life of the croquet-ground, and full of smiles and flushes. She was a good player, and had a corresponding interest in beating, but her equanimity on the present occasion was not in the least disturbed by the disgraceful defeat which Henry's awkwardness and absence of mind entailed on their aide. But her portion of sunshine for that day was brief enough, for Madeline soon returned from her boat-ride, and Henry found an excuse for leaving the game and joining her where she sat on the ground between the knees of a gigantic oak sorting pond-lilies, which the girls were admiring."
2004,"""Philip Vinson,"" she said coldly, ""are you accusing me of lying, or just of being crazy? I'm neither. I saw and heard those rats. They're here now. What's more, I guess I know where that oatmeal went, and the eggs and bacon too, and the cheese. I'm—I'm a hostage! [SNIPPET] Philip thought he was too disturbed to be able to sleep, but he did, and Norah, exhausted, was asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow. His last doubt of his wife's sanity vanished when, the next morning, they found the icebox door open and half the food gone. ""That settles it!"" Philip announced. "" Come on, Norah, put your coat on."
2005,"A score of the great vessels met their fate before the Skylark was located, and, although the terrible rays were again focused upon the intruder in all their intensity, the carnage continued. In a few minutes, however, the men heard, or rather felt, a low, intense vibration, like a silent wave of sound—a vibration which smote upon the eardrums as no possible sound could smite, a vibration which racked the joints and tortured the nerves as though the whole body were disintegrating. So sudden and terrible was the effect that Seaton uttered an involuntary yelp of surprise and pain as he once more fled into the safety of space. ""What the devil was that?"" [SNIPPET] You have one of them in your right coat pocket now."" ""Then why didn't you, or don't you, try to take it away from me?"" she asked in wonder. ""If I had objected to your having them, you would never have got them. If I didn't want you to have a gun now, I would take it away from you. You know[536] that, don't you?"" and his black eyes stared into her violet ones with such calm certainty of his ability that she felt her heart sink."
2006,"‘Mr Pinch, Mr Pinch!’ said Pecksniff, wheeling his chair about, and looking at him with an aspect of the deepest melancholy, ‘I did not expect this from you. I have not deserved this from you!’  ‘No, but upon my word, sir—’ urged Pinch.  ‘The less you say, Mr Pinch,’ interposed the other, ‘the better. I utter no complaint. Make no defence.’ [SNIPPET] But, through all the spheres it would go forth that the Norrises, deceived by gentlemanly manners and appearances, had, falling from their high estate, ‘received’ a dollarless and unknown man. O guardian eagle of the pure Republic, had they lived for this!  ‘You will allow me,’ said Martin, after a terrible silence, ‘to take my leave. I feel that I am the cause of at least as much embarrassment here, as I have brought upon myself. But I am bound, before I go, to exonerate this gentleman, who, in introducing me to such society, was quite ignorant of my unworthiness, I assure you.’"
2007,"She remembers and loves you as you would remember and love that child; but you do not know her any more than that child would know you. You both share the name of Ida Ludington, according to the usage of men as to names; but I think there is no danger of your being confounded with each other, either in your own eyes or those of lookers-on."" Ida had at last comprehended. The piercing look, expressive of mingled attraction and repulsion, which she fixed upon Miss Ludington, left no doubt of that. It implied alarm, mistrust, and something that was almost defiance, yet with hints of a possible tenderness. It was such a look as a daughter, stolen from her cradle and grown to maidenhood among strangers, might fix upon the woman claiming to be her mother, except that not only was Miss Ludington a stranger to Ida, but the relation which she claimed to sustain to her was one that had never before been realized between living persons on earth, however it might be, in heaven. ""Do you understand?"" [SNIPPET] If men had believed all the members of a family to have but one soul among them, their mistake would have been more excusable, for the members of a family are, at least, alive at the same time, while the persons of an individual are not even that. Dr. Hull said that he had gathered from Mrs. Legrand's communications that she had seen many things which would teach mortals not to grieve for their departed friends, as for shades exiled to a world of strangers. To such mourners she sent word that their own past selves, who have likewise vanished from the earth, are keeping their dear dead company in heaven. And far more congenial company to them are these past selves than their present selves would be, who, through years and changes since their separation, have often grown out of sympathy with the departed, as they will find when they shall meet them. The aged husband, who has mourned all his life the bride taken from him in girlhood, will find himself well-nigh a stranger to her, and his mourning to have been superfluous; for all these years his own former self, the husband of her youth, has borne her company. Dr. Hull said, in closing, that, as probably Miss Ludington would presume, his particular motive in making bold to break in upon her privacy was a desire, which he was sure she would not confound with vulgar curiosity, to see again the young lady who had succeeded to his friend's earthly life in so wonderful a manner, and to learn, what, if any, were the later developments in her case."
2008,"He couldn't let Gramps take the mousetrapped anti-gerasone—but, if he warned Gramps about it, Gramps would certainly make life in the apartment, which was merely insufferable now, harrowing. Lou glanced into the living room and saw that the Fords, Emerald among them, were momentarily at rest, relishing the botches that the McGarveys had made of their lives. Stealthily, he went into the bathroom, locked the door as well as he could and began to pour the contents of Gramps' bottle down the drain. He was going to refill it with full-strength anti-gerasone from the 22 smaller bottles on the shelf. [SNIPPET] And first one who lets on to anybody outside how good jail is ain't never getting back in!"" The prisoners instantly fell silent. The living room of the apartment darkened for a moment as the riot scenes faded on the television screen, and then the face of the announcer appeared, like the Sun coming from behind a cloud. "" And now, friends,"" he said, ""I have a special message from the makers of anti-gerasone, a message for all you folks over 150. Are you hampered socially by wrinkles, by stiffness of joints and discoloration or loss of hair, all because these things came upon you before anti-gerasone was developed?"
2009,"Just so we're movin'!"" ""O.K. Put it to a vote of the men outside. Do we stay, and maybe get croaked, or do we fall back and conserve our strength until we need it? Take care of it, eh, Davey?"" Crockett picked up his guitar and went outside. Travis roared, ""This is insubordination! Treason!"" [SNIPPET] That's the way we do it in Congress. Compromise, everybody happy. We never allowed ourselves to be led nowhere we didn't want to go, I can tell you! And Bill, you got to admit that we're in better bargaining position if we're out in the open, than if old Santa Anna's got us penned up in this old Alamo."" ""Ord,"" Travis said despairingly. """
2010,"Everything bore a simple and practical aspect. This intercourse with the spiritual world was evidently as familiar an occupation with Mrs. Vulpes as eating her dinner or riding in an omnibus. ""You come for a communication, Mr. Linley?"" said the medium, in a dry, businesslike tone of voice. ""By appointment—yes."" ""What sort of communication do you want?—a written one?"" ""Yes—I wish for a written one."" [SNIPPET] Every great genius is mad upon the subject in which he is greatest. The unsuccessful madman is disgraced and called a lunatic. Mad or not, I set myself to work with a zeal which few scientific students have ever equaled. I had everything to learn relative to the delicate study upon which I had embarked—a study involving the most earnest patience, the most rigid analytic powers, the steadiest hand, the most untiring eye, the most refined and subtile manipulation. For a long time half my apparatus lay inactively on the shelves of my laboratory, which was now most amply furnished with every possible contrivance for facilitating my investigations."
2011,"""First tell me better what it's like."" ""I told you already. Make me stop being it."" ""What are you afraid of? Why don't you see what it's like first, before you change back? This is a valuable experience."" [SNIPPET] The act made her aware, for the first time, of the immense significance of the experiment. She dropped her quarrel completely and walked over to the sink to get a good look at what was being done. All she saw in the sink was a wadded, wet Corn Flake box, the empty sardine tin and spillings from the juicer, which by this time was beginning to take on a distinctive and unpleasant odor. Bob gave Bonnie the job of adding seven pinches of salt and some cocoa to the concoction. ""What's it going to be, Bob?"""
2012,"No one,"" Mattern repeated. "" No one at all."" The patterns shifted and darkened. "" Then I must be getting careless. I am growing old."" [SNIPPET] You know that. When I was a kid, she could fool me into believing she had a hold over me. But the hold is a psychological one; that's the only thing that could carry over from universe to universe. And I'm strong enough to break it now."""
2013,"The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages, about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station. The carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly covered. For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it. Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily together, their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors. The bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet, and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron. “ [SNIPPET] And I consider my idea very important, but it turns out really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as doing for that bear. So one goes on living, amusing oneself with hunting, with work—anything so as not to think of death!”  Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened to Levin.  “Well, of course!"
2014,"That's what we're going to be seeing."" Situation One-Two-One was a standard war game. The CIA man was well acquainted with it. He watched the general flip a switch, then sit back and fold his arms over his chest. A row of lights on the desk console began blinking on and off, one, two, three ... down to the end of the row, then back to the beginning again, on and off, on and off . And then, somehow, he could see it! He was poised incredibly somewhere in space, and he could see it all in a funny, blurry-double-sighted, dream-like way. [SNIPPET] The nations that had built the weapons no longer existed. By all the rules he knew of, the war should have been ended. Yet the fighting did not end. The machine knew better. There were still many ways to kill an enemy."
2015,"Jack said he would—and then another—and, in a word, they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo and I, with the third man, went back to the boat, where we told them we would stay for them, and take care to take in as many of them as should be left; for I told them it was a mad thing they were going about, and supposed most of them would have the fate of Tom Jeffry. They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come off again, and they would take care, &c.; so away they went. I entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their own, and that they were entrusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of their help, and that they could not answer for it to God or man. [SNIPPET] Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about four miles off, in order to provide some horses which they wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the long march over the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put my design in execution. I communicated it to the Scots merchant, of whose courage I had sufficient testimony; I told him what I had seen, and with what indignation I had since thought that human nature could be so degenerate; I told him if I could get but four or five men well armed to go with me, I was resolved to go and destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them see that it had no power to help itself, and consequently could not be an object of worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that offered sacrifices to it. He at first objected to my plan as useless, seeing that, owing to the gross ignorance of the people, they could not be brought to profit by the lesson I meant to teach them; and added that, from his knowledge of the country and its customs, he feared we should fall into great peril by giving offence to these brutal idol worshippers. This somewhat stayed my purpose, but I was still uneasy all that day to put my project in execution; and that evening, meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about the town, I again called upon him to aid me in it."
2016,"It's frozen solid already; we needn't worry about spilling. The temperature is about—five eighty. Give me the markers, please."" Another pause, shorter this time. Zaino wondered how much of that could be laid to a faster walk without the ladle and how much to the lessening distance between flow and tractor. "" I'm tossing the first marker close to the edge—it's landed less than a foot from the lava. They're all on a light cord at ten-foot intervals; I'm paying out the cord as I go back to the tractor. [SNIPPET] ""Yes, sir. You can put the main switch anywhere in a D. C. circuit. Where are the seismology stores we never had to use?"" Four minutes later the tractor set out from the Albireo, carrying Rowson and Zaino. Six minutes after that it stopped at the base of the ash cone which formed the north side of the valley from which the lava was coming. They parked a quarter of the way around the cone's base from the emerging flood and started to climb on foot, both carrying burdens."
2017,"It will—"" It did. The rocket exploded. Mrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like a doll. She heard the great screamings and saw the flashes of bodies sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery light. ""Help, help!"" [SNIPPET] His large liquid dark eyes were so improbable that one of the old ladies had facetiously claimed she saw a mosquito cloud hovering over them as they did around summer rain-barrels. And Mrs. Bellowes sometimes caught the scent of the theatrical mothball and the smell of calliope steam on his sharply pressed suit. But with the same savage rationalization that had greeted all other disappointments in her rickety life, she bit at the suspicion and whispered, ""This time it's real. This time it'll work. Haven't we got a rocket?"" Mr. Thirkell bowed. He smiled a sudden Comedy Mask smile."
2018,"""So right then and there,"" Pa went on, and now I could tell that he heard the steps, too, and was talking loud so we maybe wouldn't hear them, ""right then and there I told myself that I was going on as if we had all eternity ahead of us. I'd have children and teach them all I could. I'd get them to read books. I'd plan for the future, try to enlarge and seal the Nest. I'd do what I could to keep everything beautiful and growing. [SNIPPET] So after they'd got things going smoothly at Los Alamos, which had taken years, they'd decided to make some trips to likely places where there might be other survivors. No good trying long-distance radio signals, of course, since there was no atmosphere to carry them around the curve of the Earth. Well, they'd found other colonies at Argonne and Brookhaven and way around the world at Harwell and Tanna Tuva. And now they'd been giving our city a look, not really expecting to find anything. But they had an instrument that noticed the faintest heat waves and it had told them there was something warm down here, so they'd landed to investigate. Of course we hadn't heard them land, since there was no air to carry the sound, and they'd had to investigate around quite a while before finding us. Their instruments had given them a wrong steer and they'd wasted some time in the building across the street."
2019,"Death advanced towards me with rapid strides, and I expected that every succeeding moment would be that of my dissolution. Suddenly a neighbouring Tomb caught my eye: A Basket stood upon it, which till then I had not observed. I started from my seat: I made towards it as swiftly as my exhausted frame would permit. How eagerly did I seize the Basket, on finding it to contain a loaf of coarse bread and a small bottle of water. [SNIPPET] Lastly He took out a large Bible, and beckoned me to follow him into the Circle. I obeyed.  “Be cautious not to utter a syllable!” whispered the Stranger; “Step not out of the circle, and as you love yourself, dare not to look upon my face!”  Holding the Crucifix in one hand, the Bible in the other, He seemed to read with profound attention."
2020,"No use making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus, you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal points."" ""That may be,"" Junior said stubbornly, ""but I still want to know why this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! [SNIPPET] And if it did work, it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug—"" ""Mother!"" Junior warned. "" We decided not to talk about it any more. Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr."
2021,"cried my mother; ""our dear boy, Mr. Wringhim! Look at him, and speak to him: he is either dying or translated, sir!""  He looked at me with a countenance of great alarm; mumbling some sentences to himself, and then taking me by the arm, as if to feel my pulse, he said, with a faltering voice: ""Something has indeed befallen you, either in body or mind, boy, for you are transformed, since the morning, that I could not have known you for the same person. Have you met with any accident?""  ""No.""  ""Have you seen anything out of the ordinary course of nature?"" [SNIPPET] My illustrious friend still continuing to sound in my ears the imperious duty to which I was called, of making away with my sinful relations, and quoting many parallel actions out of the Scriptures, and the writings of the holy fathers, of the pleasure the Lord took in such as executed his vengeance on the wicked, I was obliged to acquiesce in his measures, though with certain limitations. It was not easy to answer his arguments, and yet I was afraid that he soon perceived a leaning to his will on my part. "" If the acts of Jehu, in rooting out the whole house of his master, were ordered and approved-of by the Lord,"" said he, ""would it not have been more praiseworthy if one of Ahab's own sons had stood up for the cause of the God of Israel, and rooted out the sinners and their idols out of the land?""  ""It would certainly,"" said I. ""To our duty to God all other duties must yield.""  ""Go thou then and do likewise,"" said he. "" Thou are called to a high vocation; to cleanse the sanctuary of thy God in this thy native land by the shedding of blood; go thou then like a ruling energy, a master spirit of desolation in the dwellings of the wicked, and high shall be your reward both here and hereafter."""
2022,"Pepe dropped his face into his hands and his shoulders shook. I flicked the gun his way and snapped at him. ""Sit up, Pepe. I find it very hard to believe that you are crying. [SNIPPET] The mood of space piracy had seized me and I had been going along fine. Until this glaring inconsistency jumped out and hit me square in the eye. Why a battleship? Why all the trouble and years of work to get a ship that two people could just barely manage? With a tenth of the effort Pepe could have had a cruiser that would have suited his purposes just as well. Just as good for space piracy, that is—but not for his purposes. He had wanted a battleship, and he had gotten himself a battleship."
2023,"I was unconscious. Gradually, I became aware of a faint, distant whining. It became plainer. A desperate feeling of agony possessed me. I struggled madly for breath, and tried to shout. A moment, and I got my breath more easily. I was conscious that something was licking my hand. [SNIPPET] This house is, as I have said before, surrounded by a huge estate, and wild and uncultivated gardens. Away at the back, distant some three hundred yards, is a dark, deep ravine—spoken of as the 'Pit,' by the peasantry. At the bottom runs a sluggish stream so overhung by trees as scarcely to be seen from above. In passing, I must explain that this river has a subterranean origin, emerging suddenly at the East end of the ravine, and disappearing, as abruptly, beneath the cliffs that form its Western extremity. It was some months after my vision (if vision it were) of the great Plain that my attention was particularly attracted to the Pit. I happened, one day, to be walking along its Southern edge, when, suddenly, several pieces of rock and shale were dislodged from the face of the cliff immediately beneath me, and fell with a sullen crash through the trees."
2024,"But the younger man was agile, and kept his feet. As Gorton rushed, his long, heavy arms flailing, Hanlon ducked away and jumped back far enough to get a firm footing on a cleared space of floor. All Corps cadets were well-trained in both Marquis of Queensbury boxing, Judo and no-holds-barred barroom brawling. He knew all the questions ... and all the answers. So Hanlon stepped back in quickly. [SNIPPET] But those are incidentals. You've given us the 'what' and 'who' we needed to know. But I see you're dressed, and I'm hungry. Let's go eat."""
2025,"So now the device and my desk are both untouchable. “Go over to the desk and try to touch it,” said Garvers dryly. His friend got up and ambled over to the desk. There he saw a small black box resting near a paperweight. Its toggle switch was at the “on” position, and it was lying on its side. He tried to pick the box up, but his hand slid effortlessly through it as if it were so much air. [SNIPPET] “Well!” Max said. He passed his hand through the desk again. “ Well, well. Are you sure Busch told you everything?” “Busch! He honestly wants to help and we have taken him through the mill."
2026,"So we come back home to Newyork and they lock us up in the Armory. Won't pay us. Won't let us go nowhere. They had cops guarding us. City cops."" Lane sneered. "" [SNIPPET] Over and out."" Lane pressed the stud on his gauntlet again. He turned to Gerri. ""You're okay. I wish I could let you out. Old cybrain says I can't. Says if I drop the force-globe for a second, they'll fire into the room, and then we'll both be dead."""
2027,"The greater part of the next day was spent in moving the rest of my belongings to my new quarters and in settling down there. Indeed, so occupied was I with this task, that the approach of darkness found me quite unprepared for wave contact with Mars. I had been obliged to take my instrument apart in order to allow the larger pieces of furniture to be brought into the room, and it required almost two hours to put it together again.

2028,"I trembled as I sought the luminous world in miniature that contained my all. Animula was there. I had left the gas-lamp, surrounded by its moderators, burning, when I went to bed the night before. I found the sylph bathing, as it were, with an expression of pleasure animating her features, in the brilliant light which surrounded her. She tossed her lustrous golden hair over her shoulders with innocent coquetry. [SNIPPET] Not a living thing, apparently, inhabited that dazzling expanse. I comprehended instantly that, by the wondrous power of my lens, I had penetrated beyond the grosser particles of aqueous matter, beyond the realms of infusoria and protozoa, down to the original gaseous globule, into whose luminous interior I was gazing, as into an almost boundless dome filled with a supernatural radiance. It was, however, no brilliant void into which I looked. On every side I beheld beautiful inorganic forms, of unknown texture, and colored with the most enchanting hues. These forms presented the appearance of what might be called, for want of a more specific definition, foliated clouds of the highest rarity; that is, they undulated and broke into vegetable formations, and were tinged with splendors compared with which the gilding of our autumn woodlands is as dross compared with gold."
2029,"My name is George Hartman."" ""Emmett Corbin."" ""Gloria ... Gloria White."" The pilot said with grim urgency: ""We've got to do something. [SNIPPET] The enemy ship?"" he asked. George nodded. "" During the skirmish at Arcturus, we managed to capture one of their ships and I was a member of a group that studied it. I'm sure I can fly one of their vessels, for the controls are far simpler than ours. Most of the Agronians have left their ship to study ours, and that leaves only a skeleton crew on board. We can use our spacesuit jets to cross the distance."
2030,"""Yup, maybe so,"" said the other. "" But it's flying too high for us."" ""I must be a silly old man,"" Solomon thought, scanning the cleared space behind his tow truck where he remembered an engine. There was nothing there, and as Solomon now figured it, never had been. Heart heavy with belief in the temporary foolishness of age, Solomon went to the hub cap, glittering the sun where it lit after bouncing off the fender. It was untied from the string, and in the tool tray, before Solomon realized he'd not been daydreaming. [SNIPPET] Well, no, it hadn't. But as you can imagine, things happened rather fast. They let Solomon get clean denims and his razor. Then without a bye-your-leave, hustled him to the Ontario airport where an unmarked jet flew him to Washington and a hurriedly arranged meeting with the President. They left guards posted inside the fence of Solomon's yard, so they'll cause no attention while protecting his property. A rugged individual sits in the office and tells buyers and sellers alike, that he is Solomon's nephew. "" The old man had to take a trip in a hurry."""
2031,"He heard the trampling and his eyes snapped open. Never sleep on a strange planet, he told himself futilely. The Merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of terror. The Explorer called, ""It's only a native of this planet. It won't harm you."" [SNIPPET] Call him Red. I call him that myself. Now tell me, what are you two up to, eh?"" Slim looked away. "" Why—just exploring, sir."""
2032,"I had to bide my time. I told him I'd help him. I was waiting for the chance to get to you. He was by the interphone a few minutes ago. It was the chance I needed. I pulled my blaster, covered him. He made a dash for freedom so I had to kill him."" [SNIPPET] Lynn shrugged slim shoulders. "" It wouldn't make any difference. He is not stationed on Mars."" Horn jumped to his feet. "" You will help me?"" ""If I can."" ""Can you get me the ship?"""
2033,"It was scrawling in huge letters, over and over, ""NO NO NO"". ""It is too bad we cannot wait,"" said Luke, ""but it has to be done before the new ones get here. They would not like it, probably."" He let the pointer go, and it hung where he had left it. With two jointed claws he seized Weaver's hand and straightened it out to match the other, removing the pen. With a third claw he thrust a slender needle under the skin. Instantly the hand was as rigid as the rest of Weaver's body. [SNIPPET] He pressed the first button under one of them, and the screen lighted up. He pressed the second button, then all the others in turn. They all showed him the same thing—the view he had seen from the viewport in the airlock: stars, and nothing but stars. The Moon, incredibly, had disappeared. He was in space. His first thought, when he was able to think connectedly again, was to find the Aurigean and make him put things right."
2034,"""To be sure. To be sure,"" General Webb muttered. He didn't much like tartness in responses, but the Secretary of Defense, unfortunately, was hardly a subordinate, and therefore not subject to the general's choler. Silly little ass! he said to himself. [SNIPPET] Whitlow half-expected him to remove his hat, but he did not. They drove onward, then, in silence, until they passed by a large field, in the center of which Whitlow could discern the outlines of an immense bull's-eye, in front of a tall, somewhat rickety khaki-colored reviewing stand, draped in tired bunting. ""What's that?"" asked Whitlow, relinquishing his grip on his brief case long enough to point toward the field. ""Ssssh!"" said ""Smiley"" Webb. """
2035,"""Siloo, Siloo!"" cried Alumion hastily in a tone of command. "" Down, Siloo!"" The serpent at once obeyed her voice and retired again to his dish. ""He thought I was going to harm you,"" I exclaimed, not without a sense of relief. "" Or perhaps he was jealous of me."" ""Remember this is holy ground,"" responded Alumion. [SNIPPET] ""Why?"" ""Well, make it a draw."" ""Oh, dear no. Let's play it out."" ""I can't. I'm sorry to say I must leave you now. I have just received a telegram making an urgent appointment."
2036,"None of the great cities of your day have become extinct, but their populations are but small fractions of what they were."" ""But Boston is certainly a far finer-looking city than in my day."" ""All the modern cities are far finer and fairer in every way than their predecessors and infinitely fitter for human habitation, but in order to make them so it was necessary to get rid of their surplus population. There are in Boston to-day perhaps a quarter as many people as lived in the same limits in the Boston of your day, and that is simply because there were four times as many people within those limits as could be housed and furnished with environments consistent with the modern idea of healthful and agreeable living. New York, having been far worse crowded than Boston, has lost a still larger proportion of its former population. Were you to visit Manhattan Island I fancy your first impression would be that the Central Park of your day had been extended all the way from the Battery to Harlem River, though in fact the place is rather thickly built up according to modern notions, some two hundred and fifty thousand people living there among the groves and fountains."" ""And you say this amazing depopulation took place at once after the Revolution?"" [SNIPPET] Alexander and Napoleon mistook their trade; they should have been bankers, not soldiers. But, indeed, the time was not in their day ripe for a world-wide money dynasty, such as we have been speaking of. Kings had a rude way of interfering with the so-called rights of property when they conflicted with royal prestige or produced dangerous popular discontent. Tyrants themselves, they did not willingly brook rival tyrants in their dominions."
2037,"""Why, just depositing some of my stuff in a safety deposit box,"" he said, surprised. "" Why?"" ""How did you get your own box so quickly?"" ""What do you mean so quickly? I went in yesterday and asked if one was available, and the girl clerk signed me up for it, and said I could get entry today."" ""Oh, I see. [SNIPPET] The admiral almost jumped. "" Why, I am not ...,"" then he looked surprised, and laughed. "" By Snyder, I was, too!"" He sobered. "" But if you can do that, even if you can't actually read the words of the thought, you'll still be able to help, I'm sure. No, you keep on studying. I'll bet you'll be able to do a lot more before long."""
2038,"Finally, hundreds of light-years from what had been its home, it located an Earth-type world, accepted it from a billion miles off, and swung into an approach that would last exactly eighteen years. Immediately, pumps delivered measured quantities of oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Circuits closed to move four tiny frozen eggs next to frozen spermatozoa. The temperature gradually increased to a heat once maintained by animals now extinct. [SNIPPET] After all, he recalled, they were pre-set. They had to act like that when he disobeyed them. Going against them wasn't necessarily the same as doing wrong. It took an act of will and intelligence far in advance of his seven years, for Adam realized that if he continued like this, the conditioning would eat at his brain like acid and guilt would rise in the etch. So, from under the ship's deck, he turned the mecs permanently off. The stars changed with the passing years."
2039,"Willy, then—Lou's father—was the new favorite. Willy, who looked almost as young as Lou, though he was 142, did a poor job of concealing his pleasure. He glanced shyly at the daybed, which would become his, and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back into the hall, back to the worst spot of all by the bathroom door. Gramps missed none of the high drama he had authored and he gave his own familiar role everything he had. Frowning and running his finger along each line, as though he were seeing the will for the first time, he read aloud in a deep portentous monotone, like a bass note on a cathedral organ. ""I, Harold D. Ford, residing in Building 257 of Alden Village, New York City, Connecticut, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my last Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made."" [SNIPPET] ""Actually,"" said Willy, who was the oldest one present, ""it's just like the old system, where the oldest people head up things with their headquarters in here and—"" ""I like that!"" exclaimed Em. "" Lou owns as much of it as you do, and I say it ought to be for the oldest one who's still working. You can snooze around here all day, waiting for your pension check, while poor Lou stumbles in here after work, all tuckered out, and—"" ""How about letting somebody who's never had any privacy get a little crack at it?"""
2040,"if science had only the means of conducting and reduplicating sounds, as it does the rays of light, what carols of happiness would then have entranced my ears! what jubilant hymns to Adonis would have thrilled the illumined air! I now comprehended how it was that the Count de Gabalis peopled his mystic world with sylphs—beautiful beings whose breath of life was lambent fire, and who sported forever in regions of purest ether and purest light. The Rosicrucian had anticipated the wonder that I had practically realized. [SNIPPET] No biological theory could account for the discovery of the lens. The medium might, by means of biological rapport with my mind, have gone so far as to read my questions, and reply to them coherently. But biology could not enable her to discover that magnetic currents would so alter the crystals of the diamond as to remedy its previous defects, and admit of its being polished into a perfect lens. Some such theory may have passed through my head, it is true; but if so, I had forgotten it. In my excited condition of mind there was no course left but to become a convert, and it was in a state of the most painful nervous exaltation that I left the medium's house that evening. She accompanied me to the door, hoping that I was satisfied."
2041,"""The story of where all that money went still hasn't been told,"" he said pointedly. "" But the story of who got away with this two billion will be different."" Colonel Jennings said nothing. The white hot rage mounting within him made it impossible for him to speak. The senator straightened up and walked back over to his chair. He waved a hand in the direction of Major Eddy. [SNIPPET] I wonder if man will do any better on the planets than he has done here."" ""Well, of course,"" Colonel Jennings answered with sympathy in his voice, ""under Hitler and all the things you went through, I don't blame you for being a little bitter. But not all mankind is like that, you know. As long as you've been in our country, Professor, you've never looked around you. You've been working on this, never lifting your head...."" He dragged the phone toward him and began speaking angrily into its mouthpiece before he had brought it to his lips. ""What the hell's the matter now?"
2042,"The Lord. So long as he shall live on earth, Do with him all that you desire. Man errs and staggers from his birth. Mephistopheles. Thank you; I never did aspire To have with dead folk much transaction. In full fresh cheeks I take the greatest satisfaction. A corpse will never find me in the house; I love to play as puss does with the mouse. [SNIPPET] Are we the sport of every puff of air? And if she suddenly should enter now, How would she thy presumptuous folly humble! Big John-o'dreams! ah, how wouldst thou Sink at her feet, collapse and crumble! Mephistopheles."
2043,"and the Woggle-Bug stood up and turned himself around slowly, that all might examine his person.  “He must have been a good tailor,” said the Scarecrow, somewhat enviously.  “He was a good-hearted tailor, at any rate,” observed Nick Chopper.  “But where were you going, when you met us?” Tip asked the Woggle-Bug. [SNIPPET] asked the Saw-Horse, abruptly. “ Then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very easily.”  They looked at each other in surprise, for the Saw-Horse was considered the most stupid of the entire party.  “You make me quite ashamed of myself,” said the Scarecrow, bowing low to the Saw-Horse."
2044,"""What can I do?"" ""You can help me get away. A turbo-engine space ship. That's all I need. It's small and fast."" [SNIPPET] ""I'm Harry Horn."" ""I know."" ""You've got to help me."" His voice was urgent, pleading."
2045,"This I cannot let pass, I say ""Hi! According to College rumor you cannot be more than thirty-six; I'm twenty-three."" M'Clare says in a bemused sort of way He will be thirty-seven in a couple of months. I say, ""I will be twenty-four next week and your arithmetic is still screwy; and here is another datum you got wrong. I do love you. Very much."" He says, ""Golden Liz."" [SNIPPET] They don't seem to have found anything suspicious. Visibility was bad, of course, and you can't leave foot-prints in shingle—"" Hold on, what is all this? M'Clare says, ""We've had two couriers while you were asleep. Yes, I know it's not ordinarily possible for a ship on Mass-Time to get news."
2046,"Luke moved the pantograph pointer, again and again, until it touched Weaver's robed body. With every motion, the aircar bored a tunnel into the stone to the exact depth required, and backed out again. Slowly a form was beginning to emerge. The distant screech of the grinder was muffled and not unpleasant. Weaver felt a trifle sleepy. The top of one extended arm was done. The aircar moved over and began the other, leaving the head still buried in stone. [SNIPPET] He wrote, ""You never told me this. You will all do a penance for it."" Luke was dabbing the pointer carefully at the bald top of Weaver's head. His horny, complicated face was unpleasantly close, the mandibles unpleasantly big even behind his mouth veil."
2047,"yelled a long-necked, flap-eared youth, suddenly. "" He's got an iron bar in that rope!"" They had come too late to see the parachute drop. Tristan grinned and pulled himself down the rope, which of course fell limp behind him. [SNIPPET] Then the thing happened; the thing which to this hour makes the fabric of space with its unknown forces seem an insecure and eery garment for the body of man. Over the slight rise beyond the tree, as the air crackled, roared and shook under the thunder-blasts, there appeared an object moving in long, leisurely bounds, drifting before the wind, and touching the ground lightly each time. It was about eighteen inches in diameter, globular, glowing with coruscating fires, red, green, and yellow; a thing of unearthly and wholly sinister beauty. Alice poised with one foot half raised, and shrieked at Tristan, half terrified, half elated at the sight. He wheeled quickly, there under the tree, and slowly backed away as the thing drifted in to keep him company in his shelter. We could not see his face, but there was a stiffness to his figure indicating something like fear."
2048,"Our course took us over the metropolis, which lay beneath us like a vast conflagration. Far as the eye could see, myriads of lights glimmered like watch fires through the murk of the dismal streets, growing thicker and thicker as we approached the heart of the city, and appearing to blend their lustres. Through the midst of the glittering expanse we could trace the black tide of the river, crossed by the sparkling lines of the bridges, and reflecting the red lanterns of the ships and barges. The principal squares and thoroughfares were picked out, with rows and clusters of gas and electric lamps, as with studs of gold and silver. The clock on the Houses of Parliament glowed like the full moon on a harvest night. Now and again the weird blaze of a furnace, or the shifting beam of an advertisement, attracted our attention. [SNIPPET] he added, with a penetrating glance of his grey eyes, which gleamed under their bushy brows like a pool of water in a cavern overhung with brambles, ""promise me that whatever you see and hear will remain a secret on your part. Never breathe a word of it to a living soul. You are the only person, except my own daughter, whom I have ever taken into my confidence."" I gave him my word of honour."
2049,"The greatest words of defiance ever written in the English tongue—and so much more literate than that chap at Bascogne."" ""You mean to send that?"" Jim gasped. The man called Davey was holding his head in his hands. [SNIPPET] You're O.K., but you just don't know how to be one of the boys. You got to learn that no dog is better'n any other."" ""No,"" Travis croaked hoarsely. "" I stay."
2050,"Do you read me, Captain? I've drawn them to the north with fire bombs from the ship's guns.... They've never guessed your course."" ""No signs of Gravgak? Or Leeger?"" ""Not a sign. [SNIPPET] Campbell and I came to learn about the serpent river."" I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not knowing the Benzendella equivalent. I made an eel-like motion with my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain, the footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked around to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent figure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and green diamond markings—Gravgak."
2051,"If he did, he would never have been selected for Lydna in the first place. That's one comfort we have—it's a sort of proof we had reared a child far above the average. It was just weakness in me to half wish that Hal hadn't been so healthy, so handsome, so intelligent, so fine in character. They were a wonderful lot. [SNIPPET] But her voice was still trembling when she turned to Bet. ""A year from now,"" she said, ""we'll all be back here in this room and, this time, part of Hal will be here with us—his son, our little Hal."" ""It might be our little Hallie."" Bet smiled through her tears. "" It will be ten weeks before I can run the Schuster test to find out."""
2052,"This is the barrel of the weapon, Master,"" he said. "" As You commanded, it is rifled so that the missile will spin. Here the missile is inserted at the breech, according to Your direction. Here is the mechanism which turns and aims the weapon, as You commanded. It is shown in greater detail on this second sheet.... And here, on the third, is the missile itself. It is hollow and filled with explosive powder, as You ordered, and there is in the tip a device which will attract it to the target."" Weaver gravely nodded. "" [SNIPPET] He stepped forward, mounted the single step to Weaver's dais, and laid a sheaf of papers on the desk. "" This is a preliminary attempt which one called Peter Smith has made with my unworthy help."" ""I will read it later,"" Weaver told him. It was poor stuff, no doubt—what else could one expect?—but it was a start."
2053,"We returned to the airship, raid rose into the cool, thin air. I stood behind her on the way back, watching her slender body as she guided the plane. Once in a while she would turn her head and look up at me over her shoulder, then quickly look away again. ""Why is it,"" I asked her as we passed over the valleys and the river on our way home, ""why is it that these hills have such a cultivated look—as though they had been laid out?"" She glanced back, and smiled. ""They have been laid out,"" she said. "" [SNIPPET] Then I happened to glance at a mirror for the first time. I stood amazed and transfixed. Overnight I had grown a beard such as wanderers bring back with them from the wilderness. Under the beard, my face seemed to have altered somehow, to have changed in some peculiar way. Physically it appeared younger, with an expression of calm and repose such as I had never before seen on a man's face."
2054,"I do what I can. You,” she said to the Duke, “must go on to the platform and announce it.”  “Announce what?”  “Why, that I am going to do my tricks! All you need say is ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure to—’ What is the matter now?” [SNIPPET] In the middle of his second year, he had gone so far that a College Meeting had to be held, and he was sent down for the rest of term. The Warden placed his own landau at the disposal of the illustrious young exile, who therein was driven to the station, followed by a long, vociferous procession of undergraduates in cabs. Now, it happened that this was a time of political excitement in London. The Liberals, who were in power, had passed through the House of Commons a measure more than usually socialistic; and this measure was down for its second reading in the Lords on the very day that the Duke left Oxford, an exile."
2055,"""Well,"" said Queen Ann, when all were again seated in Kaliko's royal cavern, ""I wonder what we shall do next. If I could find my way back to Oogaboo I'd take my army home at once, for I'm sick and tired of these dreadful hardships.""  ""Don't you want to conquer the world?"" asked Betsy.  ""No; I've changed my mind about that,"" admitted the Queen. "" [SNIPPET] Unless I remain forever masked, my dreadful face would curdle all the milk and stop all the clocks.""  ""Can't the enchantment be broken in some way?"" inquired Betsy.  Shaggy looked anxiously at Kaliko, who shook his head.  ""I am sure I can't break the enchantment,"" he said. "" Ruggedo was fond of magic, and learned a good many enchantments that we nomes know nothing of.""  ""Perhaps Ruggedo himself might break his own enchantment,"" suggested Ann; ""but unfortunately we have allowed the old King to escape."""
2056,"And seeing an old churl hard by, he asked him what men called that castle.  “Fair sir,” said he, “it is the Maiden’s Castle.”  “It is a cursed place,” said Galahad, “and all its masters are but felons, full of mischief and hardness and shame.”    “For that good reason,” said the old man, “thou wert well-advised to turn thee back.”  “For that same reason,” quoth Sir Galahad, “will I the more certainly ride on.” [SNIPPET] Then did they wheel their horses far apart, and running them together, the strange knight shivered Sir Griflet’s spear to fragments, and smote him through the shield and the left side, and broke his own spear into Sir Griflet’s body, so that the truncheon stuck there, and Sir Griflet and his horse fell down. But when the strange knight saw him overthrown, he was sore grieved, and hastily alighted, for he thought that he had slain him. Then he unlaced his helm and gave him air, and tended him carefully till he came out of his swoon, and leaving the truncheon of his spear in his body, he set him upon horse, and commended him to God, and said he had a mighty heart, and if he lived would prove a passing good knight. And so Sir Griflet rode to the court, where, by aid of good physicians, he was healed in time and his life saved.  At that same time there came before the king twelve old men, ambassadors from Lucius Tiberius, Emperor of Rome, and demanded of Arthur tribute unto Caesar for his realm, or else, said they, the emperor would destroy both him and his land."
2057,"Naturally, since those parents are in the genetically superior group, it wouldn't be fair to pit them against the two-baby families. Then there's a class for babies of artificially impregnated mothers, both married and single. It's a very popular program. The prizes are wonderful and the winners in the limited family class are allowed to have more children than their quota, all expenses paid of course."" ""I can see why it's popular all right,"" George said, ""but where do I come in?"" [SNIPPET] What'll it be, crepes suzette?"" She smiled across the table. "" Mm,"" she considered the menu carefully. "" I think I'll stick to good old American apple pie and cheese."" ""A genuine American small town girl, with small town likes and dislikes! That's what you are underneath the glamour."
2058,"“A ruin? Why?” “You tell us. Lots of mysteries here.” “What’s the planet like?” “Mostly jungle. There are polar oceans, lakes and rivers. [SNIPPET] It wore a wide belt from which dangled neat pouches and what looked like tools, although their use was obscure. There appeared to be the tip of a tail protruding from behind one of the squat legs. Behind the creature towered the faery spires of the city they’d observed from the air. “Tails?”"
2059,"She had long ago learned, Vyrko suspected, that he was a faintly over-serious young man with no small talk, and that she could enjoy his full attention only by asking to have something explained, even if for the nth time. He smiled and thought of the girls he used to talk with, not at, and of how little breath they had for talking now in the world where no one drew an unobstructed breath. It had begun with the accidental discovery in a routine laboratory analysis of a new element in the air, an inert gas which the great paleolinguist Larkish had named agnoton, the Unknown Thing, after the pattern of the similar nicknames given to others: neon, the New Thing; xenon, the Strange Thing. It had continued (the explanation ran off so automatically that his mind was free to range from the next line of the epic to the interesting question of whether the presence of ear lobes would damage the symmetry of Lavra's perfect face) it had continued with the itching and sneezing, the coughing and wheezing, with the increase of the percentage of agnoton in the atmosphere, promptly passing any other inert gas, even argon, and soon rivaling oxygen itself. And it had culminated (no, the lines were cleaner without lobes), on that day when only the three of them were here in this retreat, with the discovery that the human race was allergic to agnoton. Allergies had been conquered for a decade of generations. [SNIPPET] She was unable to resist licking the juice from her fingers. ""Then if the agnoton,"" he ventured, ""is something that they imported, is it possible that their supply might run short?"" Kirth-Labbery fiddled with the dials under the screen. It was still possible to pick up occasional glimpses from remote sectors, though by now the heart sickened in advance at the knowledge of the inevitable end of the cast."
2060,"So I do not think of our ship at all. I think of mankind. I wonder if mankind is as ready as our ship. I wonder if man will do any better on the planets than he has done here."" ""Well, of course,"" Colonel Jennings answered with sympathy in his voice, ""under Hitler and all the things you went through, I don't blame you for being a little bitter. But not all mankind is like that, you know. As long as you've been in our country, Professor, you've never looked around you. [SNIPPET] The closing of the heavy doors behind him punctuated his remark and caused him to step to the center of the bunker. Where there had seemed adequate room before, now the feeling was one of oppressive overcrowding. Unconsciously, Major Eddy squared his elbows as if to clear the space around him for the manipulation of his controls. Professor Stein sat at his radar screen, quiet, immobile, a part of the mechanisms. He was accustomed to overbearing authority whatever political tag it might wear at the moment. ""Beep. Eleven minutes,"" the signal sounded."
2061,"The waterproof gasket stripped off easily, exposing the power leads, nerve wires and the weakened knee joint. The wires disconnected, Jon unscrewed the knee above the joint and carefully placed it on the shelf in front of him. With loving care he took the replacement part from his hip pouch. It was the product of toil, purchased with his savings from three months employment on the Jersey pig farm. Jon was standing on one leg testing the new knee joint when the ceiling fluorescent flickered and came back on. Five-thirty already, he had just finished in time. A shot of oil on the new bearing completed the job; he stowed away the tools in the pouch and unlocked the door. [SNIPPET] They pushed up the crowded ramp and joined the line in front of the registration desk. The bulletin board next to the desk held a scattering of white slips announcing job openings. A clerk was pinning up new additions. Venex scanned them with his eyes, stopping at one circled in red."
2062,"Then Duvall died suddenly of a heart attack.” “And what was this invention?” “Isn’t it obvious? A machine that would enable a man to walk through walls. And Busch has no idea how the thing works, other than the general explanation that Duvall gave him. [SNIPPET] He was one of those once-in-a-lifetime fellows like Tesla. He was so shy that he didn’t bring himself to anybody’s attention, save for a few papers he published in the smaller physical societies’ magazines. It was only because he had inherited a considerable amount of money that he could do any research whatsoever.” “Hm-m-m. I seem to remember a paper about wave propagation in one of the quarterlies. Quite unorthodox, as I recall,” said Max."
2063,"""What happened?"" Lazar snapped at her. His flesh-bedded eyes studied her. ""He came to me for help. [SNIPPET] He dialed, spoke, ""You may come up now."" ""What are you doing?"" her face paled. He turned to her, smiling. "" Lazar was wondering how Sanderson and McLean escaped. You were on the master list of suspects."
2064,"And the thought was bitter. ""Like you?"" he asked. "" I think I'm in love with you!"" [SNIPPET] ""Don't you stand on ceremony here, son,"" said Polly. She looked concerned. "" You've been very sick, and we understand. If you're tired, you go right on into bed."""
2065,"François’s whip snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them.  It was a hard day’s run, up the Cañon, through Sheep Camp, past the Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled.  That day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked harder, and made poorer time. [SNIPPET] He would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber.  Here the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking."
2066,"Lying on the warm grass, with death lancing down from the sky at miles a second, he had merely to roll over. But it was simply ... too ... much ... work. Elsewhere near Earth, a recorder sped toward Galaxy Center a message which ended, ""Six Gifts tendered, all finally refused. I will now sign off and await pickup with one Juxtaposer."" [SNIPPET] ""And we're agreed on our subject?"" ""Yes to that too."" ""All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system we have to visit on this circuit."" Ernie Meeker—of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol, Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy—rubbed his chin and slanted across the street to a drugstore."
2067,"""Do you mean migratory movements?"" asked the biologist, Rastell. "" Rats have always migrated."" ""I mean nothing of the kind,"" protested Crawford. "" I mean their sudden appearance in a town or a building, their remaining there for a short time and then their sudden disappearance. The folklore and fairy tales are full of that sort of thing."" [SNIPPET] That is all. I am sorry that it happened in my office—but I thought I was doing the man a favor to loan him the place for the meeting."" That night Crawford and Willowby were talking things over. In rushed Rastell and Wilson, brushing the indignant butler aside. ""We have heard a thousand rumors,"" began Rastell, ""and read as many foolish statements in the papers about the rat tragedy, and we just couldn't wait a minute longer. You just have to tell us what happened."
2068,"The grinning dispatcher ducked into the back office and slammed the door. The wind had died down by the time the troopers entered the brilliantly lighted parking area. The temperature seemed warmer with the lessening winds but in actuality, the mercury was dropping. The snow clouds to the west were much nearer and the overcast was getting darker. But under the great overhead light tubes, the parking area was brighter than day. [SNIPPET] It accelerated from one hundred to two hundred fifty miles an hour. The great red emergency lights on the bow and stern began to blink and from the special transmitter in the hull a radio siren wail raced ahead of the car to be picked up by the emergency receptor antennas required on all vehicles. The working part of the patrol had begun. Conversation died in the speeding car, partly because of the concentration required by the troopers, secondly because all transmissions whether intercom or radio, on a code two or three run, were taped and monitored by Control. In the center of the instrument panel, an oversized radiodometer was clicking off the mileage marks as the car passed each milestone."
2069,"said Lord Antony. “ Know Lady Blakeney—the most fashionable woman in London—the wife of the richest man in England? Of course, we all know Lady Blakeney.”  “She was a school-fellow of mine at the convent in Paris,” interposed Suzanne, “and we came over to England together to learn your language. [SNIPPET] he! he!” echoed Sir Percy, good-humouredly. “ La, Madame, you honour me!"
2070,"The darkness deepened around the patches of lava shown by the driving lights; the sky darkened toward a midnight hue, with stars showing ever brighter through it; and radio reception from the Albireo began to get spotty. Gas density at the ion layer was high enough so that recombination of molecules with their radiation-freed electrons was rapid. Only occasional streamers of ionized gas reached far over Darkside. As these thinned out, so did radio reception. Camille Burkett's next broadcast came through very poorly. [SNIPPET] I haven't even had to fix a suit-radio since we touched down. How about my going out with one of the tractors on this last trip, at least?"" ""It's all right with me,"" replied Rowson, ""but Dr. Mardikian runs the professional part of this operation. I require that Spurr, Trackman, Hargedon and Aiello go as drivers, since without them even a minor mechanical problem would be more than an adventure. As I recall it, Dr. Harmon, Dr. Schlossberg, Dr. Marini and Dr. Mardikian are scheduled to go; but if any one of them is willing to let you take his or her place, I certainly don't mind."" The radioman looked around hopefully. The geologists and the biologist shook their heads negatively, firmly and unanimously; but the astronomer pondered for a moment."
2071,"There his handcuffs were removed, and the sneering marines literally and not-too-gently booted him into the street, where he sprawled face downward in a muddy puddle. Hanlon pulled himself erect, apparently mad clear through. He shook his fist at the grinning marines gathered just inside the gate. He cursed them fluently with every foul oath and name he could remember ever having heard. [SNIPPET] ""Hmmpff!"" Philander snorted defeatedly. "" What's the difference between being killed cleanly in a fight, as against a lifetime in prison, or a firing squad?"" ""You'll get neither one,"" Hanlon said quietly, remembering the power he, as a Secret Service operative, carried. "" There'll be a trial, of course, but I know that you, at least, are all okay."" ""He's boss, ain't he?"" one of the guards growled truculently. """
2072,"she murmured, as he took her in his arms. “ We’re all so proud of you!” “I’m glad someone is,” he said. “But what a fearful risk you ran! If you hadn’t been able to get your motor started—” “Why think of unpleasant things?” he said with a smile. [SNIPPET] At an altitude of less than a thousand he levelled off again, eased on down, fully expecting to feel his plane burst into flames. But though his eyebrows crisped and the gas must have boiled, the sturdy little plane made it. On a long last glide, he put her wheels down on the sandy desert floor, a bare half mile beyond that searing hell. The heat was still terrific but endurable now. He dared breathe deeper; he found his head clearing."
2073,"Her face had sobered. She looked strong. And so he was somewhat relieved. He kissed her. Perhaps it was odd that dust-mote beings still could do that. Ed and Barbara and Prell came to the parting of the ways sooner than they had intended. [SNIPPET] It was a strange, bitter thing for Eddie Dukas to watch—his mother and uncle facing each other, not friends, his mother's face a hard mask of coldness. Then, all at once, her icy poise crumbled. "" Jack isn't alive any more,"" she said. "" My husband. That's the fact that I know best. You with your glib talk, my brother, are one person directly in the chain of events that caused Jack's death. I don't accuse you, Mitch."
2074,"Attempted rape was one of the few things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crime because it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon the intended victim—and because millions of women voters had voted it a crime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc., were not crimes. They weren't crimes because the DCT didn't complete the act, and if he didn't complete the act, that meant simply that the CPA had once again functioned properly. The girl shook her head vigorously. "" [SNIPPET] On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar and a group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor. Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leaned across the table and whispered in the girl's ear, ""That's what I want to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I get convicted of a crime, I'll be able to get a good job!"" The girl's lips formed a bright red circle. "" Say! You really got big plans, don't you?"""
2075,"""George,"" Gloria wailed, her control breaking at last, ""I don't want a test-tube husband, a parent by proxy. I want a man!"" She began to cry. He came over to the couch and dropped down beside her. "" Darling, please! [SNIPPET] I would dare to go farther and say we should also provide the female, Mother America of 1995, except that our President, my fellow Alaskan, has generously decided that no one state can have both mother and father. Alaska is a man's country. It should provide the man ..."" Wearily George Turner got up and turned off the colorvision. The political pressures were increasing rapidly; that was obvious."
2076,"He was standing, his knees as stiff as iron.  ""Is it anything serious?"" asked DeMille.  ""What! has anything happened?"" [SNIPPET] They were alone in the library, and she was drinking in the details of the dinner as he related them.  ""Wasn't she at your first dinner?"" she asked, quickly.  He successfully affected mild embarrassment.  ""Yes.""  ""She must be very attractive."" There was no venom in Peggy's heart."
2077,"But luck had aided him in getting rid of his money. The bank failure had cost him $113,468.25, and ""Nopper"" Harrison had helped him to the extent of $60,000. The reckless but determined effort to give a ball had cost $30,000. What he had lost during his illness had been pretty well offset by the unlucky concert tour. The Florida trip, including medical attention, the cottage and living expenses, had entailed the expenditure of $18,500, and his princely dinners and theater parties had footed up $31,000. Taking all the facts into consideration, he felt that he had done rather well as far as he had gone, but the hardest part of the undertaking was yet to come. [SNIPPET] Men looked at him with new interest in their eyes, with fresh confidence. His unfortunate operations in the stock market had restored him to favor in all circles. The man, young or old, who could do what he had done with Lumber and Fuel well deserved the new promises that were being made for him.  Brewster bobbed uncertainly between two emotions—elation and distress. He had achieved two kinds of success—the desired and the undesired."
2078,"""It may be so. It is known to be an electric conglomeration of some kind—but that's all."" Meantime circumstances were not going well with us; the financial burden of Tristan's support, added to the strain of the situation, was becoming overwhelming. Tristan knew this and felt it keenly; this brought him to a momentous decision. He looked down at us from the ceiling one day with an expression of unusual tenseness, and announced that he was going out permanently, and to take part in the world again. ""I've gotten now so that I can bear to look out of the windows quite well. It's only a matter of time and practise until I can stand the open. [SNIPPET] ""I'm afraid,"" he said, smiling, ""that I rather yielded to the temptation to get a rise out of you. That suggestion might be unpleasantly true under special circumstances. But I particularly have an eye out for the special capacities of that weird and rare phenomenon, the fire-ball. It isn't impossible that the energy of the fire-ball went into the re-polarization rather than into a destructive concussion—hence Tristan's escape."" ""You mean its effect is qualitatively different from that of any other explosion?"" ""It may be so. It is known to be an electric conglomeration of some kind—but that's all."""
2079,"Sorry am I that the shackles of modern decorum restrain me from penning that famous rebuke; fragments of which have been attributed to every divine of old notoriety throughout Scotland. But I have it by heart; and a glorious morsel it is to put into the hands of certain incendiaries. The metaphors are so strong and so appalling that Miss Logan could only stand them a very short time; she was obliged to withdraw in confusion. The laird stood his ground with much ado, though his face was often crimsoned over with the hues of shame and anger. [SNIPPET] So miserable was my life rendered by these continued attacks that I was often obliged to lock myself up for days together, never seeing any person save my man Samuel Scrape, who was a very honest blunt fellow, a staunch Cameronian, but withal very little conversant in religious matters. He said he came from a place called Penpunt, which I thought a name so ludicrous that I called him by the name of his native village, an appellation of which he was very proud, and answered everything with more civility and perspicuity when I denominated him Penpunt, than Samuel, his own Christian name. Of this peasant was I obliged to make a companion on sundry occasions, and strange indeed were the details which he gave me concerning myself, and the ideas of the country people concerning me. I took down a few of these in writing, to put off the time, and here leave them on record to show how the best and greatest actions are misconstrued among sinful and ignorant men:  ""You say, Samuel, that I hired you myself—that I have been a good enough master to you, and have paid you your weekly wages punctually. Now, how is it that you say this, knowing, as you do, that I never hired you, and never paid you a sixpence of wages in the whole course of my life, excepting this last month?"""
2080,"We got her put to bed at once, but it was some hours before her convulsive sobbing ceased. Mrs. Temple had administered to her a soothing draught of proved efficacy, and after sitting with her till after one o'clock, I left her at last dozing off to sleep, and myself sought repose. I was quite wearied out with the weight of my anxiety, and with the crushing bitterness of seeing my dearest Constance's feelings so wounded. Yet in spite, or rather perhaps on account of my trouble, my head had scarcely touched my pillow ere I fell into a deep sleep.  A room in the south wing had been converted for the nonce into a nursery, and for the convenience of being near her infant Constance now slept in a room adjoining. As this portion of the house was somewhat isolated, Mrs. Temple had suggested that I should keep her daughter company, and occupy a room in the same passage, only removed a few doors, and this I had accordingly done. [SNIPPET] His air seemed that of a man who was constantly expecting the arrival of some evil tidings, and at times reminded me painfully of the guilty expectation of a felon who knows that a warrant is issued for his arrest.  During my visit he spoke to me frequently about his past life, and instead of showing any reluctance to discuss the subject, seemed glad of the opportunity of disburdening his mind. I gathered from him that the reading of Adrian Temple's memoirs had made a deep impression on his mind, which was no doubt intensified by the vision which he thought he saw in his rooms at Oxford, and by the discovery of the portrait at Royston. Of those singular phenomena I have no explanation to offer.  The romantic element in his disposition rendered him peculiarly susceptible to the fascination of that mysticism which breathed through Temple's narrative."
2081,"She deserved to suffer, you say? Maybe. I merely state that she did suffer.  Emerging into Catherine Street, she knew whereabouts she was, and made straight for Judas, turning away her eyes as she skirted the Broad, that place of mocked hopes and shattered ideals. [SNIPPET] Till he met Zuleika, the Duke had not known the meaning of temptation. He fought now, a St. Anthony, against the apparition. He would not look at her, and he hated her. He loved her, and he could not help seeing her. The black pearl and the pink seemed to dangle ever nearer and clearer to him, mocking him and beguiling. Inexpellible was her image."
2082,"none!” replied the malicious Dive. “ Know, miserable prince! thou art now in the abode of vengeance and despair; thy heart also will be kindled, like those of the other votaries of Eblis. [SNIPPET] It was daybreak, and the guards were snoring on their posts in careless security, when the rough trot of Alboufaki awoke them in consternation. Imagining that a group of spectres ascended from the abyss was approaching, they all without ceremony took to their heels. Vathek was at that instant with Nouronihar in the bath, hearing tales, and laughing at Bababalouk, who related them; but no sooner did the outcry of his guards reach him, than he flounced from the water like a carp, and as soon threw himself back at the sight of Carathis, who, advancing with her negresses upon Alboufaki, broke through the muslin awnings and veils of the pavilion; at this sudden apparition Nouronihar (for she was not at all times free from remorse) fancied that the moment of celestial vengeance was come, and clung about the Caliph in amorous despondence. Carathis, still seated on her camel, foamed with indignation at the spectacle which obtruded itself on her chaste view; she thundered forth without check or mercy: “Thou double-headed and four-legged monster! what means all this winding and writhing? art thou not ashamed to be seen grasping this limber sapling, in preference to the sceptre of the pre-adamite Sultans? is it then for this paltry doxy that thou hast violated the conditions in the parchment of our Giaour?"
2083,"It's obvious this Alamo place is indefensible, even if we had a thousand men."" ""But we must delay Santa Anna at all costs—"" Bowie took out a fine, dark Mexican cigar and whittled at it with his blade. Then he lit it, saying around it, ""All right, let's all calm down. Nothing a group of good men can't settle around a table. Now listen. I got in with this revolution at first because I thought old Emperor Iturbide would listen to reason and lower taxes. [SNIPPET] ""Let them come. Less will leave!"" But Jim, sour-faced turned to the other man. "" Davey? You got something to say?"" ""Hell, yes. How do we get out, after we done pinned Santa Anna down?"
2084,"In a little, I noticed that there was about these spheres, a sort of transparency, almost as though they were formed of clouded crystal, within which burned a radiance—gentle and subdued. They moved on, past me, continually, floating onward at no great speed; but rather as though they had eternity before them. A great while, I watched, and could perceive no end to them. At times, I seemed to distinguish faces, amid the cloudiness; but strangely indistinct, as though partly real, and partly formed of the mistiness through which they showed. [SNIPPET] Gradually, even this thread of light died out; and now, all that was left of our great and glorious sun, was a vast dead disk, rimmed with a thin circle of bronze-red light.   The world was held in a savage gloom—cold and intolerable. Outside, all was quiet—quiet!"
2085,"As He quitted me, the Hostess met him at the door of the room.  “The Gentleman is not quite in his right senses;” I heard him say to her in a low voice; “’Tis the natural consequence of his fall, but that will soon be over.”  One after another the Peasants returned to the Inn, and informed me that no traces had been discovered of my unfortunate Mistress.  Uneasiness now became despair. [SNIPPET] Besides, I rather wish you not to make your proposals just at present.”  “My proposals? I assure you, Segnora....”  “Oh! Segnor, I believe that your assurances of impatience are all very true; But really I must desire a little respite. It would not be quite so delicate in me to accept your hand at first sight.”  “Accept my hand?"
2086,"Anon this news came to the land of Lyonesse, and when young Tristram heard it he was angry and ashamed to think no knight of Cornwall durst assail the Irish champion. “ Alas,” said he, “that I am not a knight, that I might match this Marhaus! I pray you give me leave, sir, to depart to King Mark’s court and beg of his grace to make me knight.”  “Be ruled by thy own courage,” said his father.    So Tristram rode away forthwith to Tintagil to King Mark, and went up boldly to him and said, “Sir, give me the order of knighthood and I will fight to the uttermost with Sir Marhaus of Ireland.”  “What are ye, and whence come ye?” [SNIPPET] But when Sir Balin had passed through the gateway, the portcullis fell behind him suddenly, leaving the damsel on the outer side, with men around her, drawing their swords as if to slay her.  When he saw that, Sir Balin climbed with eager haste by wall and tower, and leaped into the castle moat, and rushed towards the damsel and her enemies, with his sword drawn, to fight and slay them. But they cried out, “Put up thy sword, Sir knight, we will not fight thee in this quarrel, for we do nothing but an ancient custom of this castle.”  Then they told him that the lady of the castle was sick, and had lain ill for many years, and might never more be cured, unless she had a silver dish full of the blood of a pure maid and a king’s daughter."
2087,"""And then more yapping colonists wanting statehood,"" the senator said dryly. "" Upsetting the balance of power. Changing things."" Jennings was silent. ""Beep, four."" ""More imports trying to get into our country duty-free,"" O'Noonan went on. "" [SNIPPET] And apparently no scientist knew it. Man advances only when he sees how it will help him stuff his gut. ""Beep, three."" For a full minute, the senator had sat lost in speculation. And what could he personally gain?"
2088,"He laughed like an idiot, while I made for the door.  I was through it, when a sudden fantastic impulse came upon me, and I went back to my successful rival, who looked nervously at the electric push.  ""Will you answer a question?"" I asked.  ""Well, within reason,"" said he.  ""How did you do it? [SNIPPET] ""I am at least deeply interested.""  ""Then your case is not hopeless. I feel that there is reason lurking in you somewhere, so we will patiently grope round for it. We will now leave the dead American and proceed with my narrative."
2089,"In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight seen by Christians; though my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number, yet when they came up we reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six canoes; some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the least six or seven. When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they had never seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards understood, know what to make of us; they came boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go about to row round us; but we called to our men in the boats not to let them come too near them. This very order brought us to an engagement with them, without our designing it; for five or six of the large canoes came so near our long-boat, that our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which they understood very well, and went back: but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats, and one of our men in the long-boat was very much wounded. However, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again. [SNIPPET] Observing this, I asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we had seen him under the bush or not; and it was his opinion we should not, but that we should talk to him first, and hear what he would say to us; so we called him in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves, and I began by asking him some particulars about his parentage and education. He told me frankly enough that his father was a clergyman who would have taught him well, but that he, Will Atkins, despised all instruction and correction; and by his brutish conduct cut the thread of all his father’s comforts and shortened his days, for that he broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return for the most affectionate treatment a father ever gave. In what he said there seemed so much sincerity of repentance, that it painfully affected me. I could not but reflect that I, too, had shortened the life of a good, tender father by my bad conduct and obstinate self-will. I was, indeed, so surprised with what he had told me, that I thought, instead of my going about to teach and instruct him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a most unexpected manner. I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly affected with it, and said to me, “Did I not say, sir, that when this man was converted he would preach to us all?"
2090,"The man was so confounded that he was not able to speak for some time; but, recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands, and turning to his wife, “Here, my dear,” says he, “did not I tell you our God, though He lives above, could hear what we have said? Here’s the book I prayed for when you and I kneeled down under the bush; now God has heard us and sent it.” When he had said so, the man fell into such passionate transports, that between the joy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that was crying. The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake that none of us were aware of; for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon her husband’s petition. It is true that providentially it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent sense; but I believe it would have been no difficult matter at that time to have persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an express messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring that individual book. But it was too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to take place, so I turned to the young woman, and told her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert in her first and more ignorant understanding of things, and begged her to explain to her that God may be very properly said to answer our petitions, when, in the course of His providence, such things are in a particular manner brought to pass as we petitioned for; but we did not expect returns from heaven in a miraculous and particular manner, and it is a mercy that it is not so. This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that there was no priestcraft used here; and I should have thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. [SNIPPET] They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come off again, and they would take care, &c.; so away they went. I entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their own, and that they were entrusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of their help, and that they could not answer for it to God or man. But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the ship: they were mad upon their journey; only they gave me good words, and begged I would not be angry; that they did not doubt but they would be back again in about an hour at furthest; for the Indian town, they said, was not above half-a mile off, though they found it above two miles before they got to it. Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it as warily as boldly; they were gallantly armed, for they had every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain and two more had poleaxes; besides all which they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked work in the world. When they went out their chief design was plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them all. When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had been the town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses, and where the town was, or how big, they knew not."
2091,"The defensive systems were simply overloaded. And when the bombs ran out, the missiles carried dust and germs and gas. On and on. For six days and six firelit nights. Launch, boost, coast, re-enter, death. And now it was over, the CIA man thought. [SNIPPET] Situation One-Two-One started, he remembered, with the discovery of missile-bearing Enemy submarines in the Gulf. Even as he watched the whole area—as though perched on a satellite—he could see, underwater and close-up, the menacing shadowy figure of a submarine gliding through the crystal blue sea. He saw, too, a patrol plane as it spotted the submarine and sent an urgent radio warning. The underwater picture dissolved in a bewildering burst of bubbles."
2092,"At which a strange voice chimes in, ""No, no, no, son, you've got it all wrong."" Mr. Yardo is with us like a well-meaning skeleton. During the next twenty-five minutes we learn a lot about Mr. Yardo including material for a good guess at how he came to be picked for this expedition; doubtless there are many experts on Reversal Of Vacuum-Induced Changes in Organic Tissues but maybe only one of them a Romantic at heart. Mr. Yardo thinks chasing the Wild Goose will do the Incognitans all the good in the galaxy, it will take their minds off controversies over interhemispherical trade and put them on to the quest of the Unobtainable; they will get to know something of the Universe outside their own little speck. Mr. Yardo has seen a good deal of the Universe in the course of advising on how to recondition space-packed meat and he found it an Uplifting Experience. We gather he finds this desperate bit of damfoolery we are on now pretty Uplifting altogether. Cray keeps surprisingly quiet but it is as well that the rest of the party start to trickle in about twenty minutes later the first arrivals remarking Oh that's where you've got to! [SNIPPET] A hand. I turn up the light. When the missile struck the big computer was wrenched loose from the floor. It careened down as the floor tilted, taking with it anything that stood in its way. M'Clare was just stooping to the fuse, I think. The computer smashed against his legs and pinned him down in the angle between the wall and the floor. His legs are hidden by it."
2093,"It is very beautiful.” “Yes,” said Tanub. “ Why did you land so far from it?” “We didn’t want to come down where we might destroy anything.” “There is nothing to destroy in the jungle,” said Tanub. “Why do you have such a big city?” asked Orne. [SNIPPET] Orne touched his throat. “ No! Give me a little more time!” “Why?” “I have a hunch about these creatures.”"
2094,"Outside, a cannon split the dusk with flame and sound as it fired from the walls. "" There is my answer!"" The man in the lounge coat shrugged. "" What I want to know is what our orders are. What does old Sam say? Sam and me were in Congress once. Sam's got good sense; he can smell the way the wind's blowin'."" [SNIPPET] Not at all as he had imagined. For an instant he wished he had chosen Drake and the Armada instead of this pack of ruffians—but no, he had never been able to stand sea sickness. He couldn't have taken the Channel, not even for five minutes. And there was no changing now. He had chosen this place and time carefully, at great expense—actually, at great risk, for the X-4-A had aborted twice, and he had had a hard time bringing her in. But it had got him here at last. And, because for a historian he had always been an impetuous and daring man, he grinned now, thinking of the glory that was to come."

It is not my decision to make. I cannot decide for my people. And if I could, the answer would still be no."

It didn't happen this way—it couldn't! The books can't be that wrong—"" In the candlelight, Travis hung his head. """
2097,"For transient guests and individuals there is accommodation on another floor. If we expect to dine here, we put in our orders the night before, selecting anything in market, according to the daily reports in the papers. The meal is as expensive or as simple as we please, though of course everything is vastly cheaper as well as better than it would be prepared at home. There is actually nothing which our people take more interest in than the perfection of the catering and cooking done for them, and I admit that we are a little vain of the success that has been attained by this branch of the service. Ah, my dear Mr. West, though other aspects of your civilization were more tragical, I can imagine that none could have been more depressing than the poor dinners you had to eat, that is, all of you who had not great wealth.""  ""You would have found none of us disposed to disagree with you on that point,"" I said. [SNIPPET] I had a little curiosity what writer you would first turn to. Ah, Dickens! You admired him, then! That is where we moderns agree with you. Judged by our standards, he overtops all the writers of his age, not because his literary genius was highest, but because his great heart beat for the poor, because he made the cause of the victims of society his own, and devoted his pen to exposing its cruelties and shams. No man of his time did so much as he to turn men's minds to the wrong and wretchedness of the old order of things, and open their eyes to the necessity of the great change that was coming, although he himself did not clearly foresee it."""
2098,"Greatly perturbed I turned and entered the building, and, with all haste, proceeded down the corridor. As I reached the portières of the large room, the sound of someone within moving about caused my heart to beat wildly, and, thrusting aside the curtains, I beheld Reon. For a moment I was mute with astonishment, then, as he smilingly advanced with extended hand, I knew instantly that he was present at Almos' request. Without further time for thought, I grasped his hand and greeted him cordially, realizing that no matter what the object of his visit was, it was known to Almos, and under no circumstances must I appear surprised. Without waiting to be questioned, Reon offered me a slip of paper on which I observed Almos' handwriting. [SNIPPET] So thrilling were my experiences during that period, so overcrowded with feverish action and strong emotions was each wonderful moment, and so entirely changed are the conditions of life as I now find it, that it is with considerable difficulty that I recall in detail all that happened prior to my remarkable discovery which opened communication between Earth and Mars. One says ""discovery"" advisedly, but let it not be imagined that communication with the planet Mars was established as a result of any careful and systematic research, or that I possessed a subtle genius for astronomical science that was destined to introduce into society what must eventually revolutionize it. Nothing could be further from the facts."
2099,"The stars changed with the passing years. The blue giant Adam used to watch from the darkside port was now a diamond chip lost in starmilk night. Ahead, a new jewel grew larger in the quartz port, a sapphire blazing hot and big—bigger than any star in his memory, closer than the Destiny had ever come to a star. Adam understood why the star was so big. He was eighteen Old Earth years of age now and the star was New Sol. Soon there would be a New Earth and maybe a New Moon. [SNIPPET] In one end of the ship, a miniature farm was born hydroponically, its automatic grinders pre-digesting ripe vegetables for the children. Animals were born, too, for food, but also companionship, and later to stock New Earth ahead. As the babies began to understand, the woman voices merged into one mechanical mother who could be heard and seen and summoned on panel screens throughout the ship. Everything became as Earthlike as possible, but because the environment was artificial, the children grew aware of their purpose in life at an age rarely reached on ancient Earth. They were two years old when their Mecmother informed them: ""You are unlike any children ever born."
2100,"""I am not jealous,"" she'd answered. "" If he had wanted others when he was away, he could have done as he wished, as a man might. But he has spoken to you as a child, not a man. I do not like that."" She didn't sound terribly angry. It was the way she phrased it that bothered Lane. ""But he is not a bad man,"" she said thoughtfully to Lane. "" [SNIPPET] I've got more sense. When a man's got a pet notion, leave it alone. You won't pry him off it and you might get him mad at you. A spaceship's too small to make enemies in. ""Suppose you get married,"" I asked him. """
2101,"Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the explosion. None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight. The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building. Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away. [SNIPPET] In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily. ""It's impossible and unbelievable,"" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater. "" How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?"" ""It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,"" one of the haggard AEC men offered timidly. """
2102,"But you can't blame us, for we're old, and it was a lovely, good and fine idea, one of the loveliest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really fool ourselves that we could get nearer to Him physically. It was the gentle, mad dream of old people, the kind of thing you hold onto for a few minutes a day, even though you know it's not true. So, all of you who want to go, you follow me in the ship."" ""But you can't go!"" said Mr. Thirkell. "" You haven't got a navigator. [SNIPPET] ""This way!"" cried Mrs. Bellowes, feeling like Madame Lafarge. "" Through the back! We've waited long enough to see the ship."
2103,"In any case you may be assured that your absence from your usual life will not cause you any harm, and that you will return after a definite time. Rest here, and keep your mind at peace. You will be safe."" Then he turned and left. I was puzzled for a while, but I forgot that shortly in the strangeness and wonder of the life I was living in a strange world. And the lake? [SNIPPET] I stood there, dripping and chill, and suddenly I realized that I had just waked up in the water. I had no recollection of falling in, nor even of being there. I could remember nothing of the previous night. A glance along the Drive told me where I was, at the corner of Fifty-third street. My apartment was only a few blocks away."
2104,"It was like releasing a bomb. Sudden pain stabbed through his body. The twin struggled in his arms, the small hands reaching blindly out for the thing they had lost. And Mary's eyes opened and all of the uncontrolled pain came, back into those eyes. [SNIPPET] They were gone. He fought down sudden panic. Where can two children, deaf and dumb and blind go in the middle of the night? Not far. He opened the door to the kitchen, hand-hunted for the hanging light. They were not there—nor were they on the small back porch. The panic passed critical mass, exploded out of control."
2105,"Solomon trudged back, followed by the short civilian and patrolman who left their curious searching to follow Solomon's lead. When he neared, the tall stranger asked, ""I see where weeds grew under other cars which, from the tracks, have been moved out in the past few weeks. How many did you have?"" ""Twenty; but these are all I have left,"" Solomon eagerly replied, hoping at last he'd a customer for the best of his old cars. "" They make classic cars, if you'd take the time to fix them up. [SNIPPET] But it's flying too high for us."" ""I must be a silly old man,"" Solomon thought, scanning the cleared space behind his tow truck where he remembered an engine. There was nothing there, and as Solomon now figured it, never had been. Heart heavy with belief in the temporary foolishness of age, Solomon went to the hub cap, glittering the sun where it lit after bouncing off the fender. It was untied from the string, and in the tool tray, before Solomon realized he'd not been daydreaming. In the cleared area, were two old manifold gaskets, several rusty nuts, and dirt blown smooth in a wide circle around greasy blocks on which he'd propped the now missing engine. That night was a whirlwind of excitement for Solomon."
2106,"Only two kinds of girls ever went near a Trooper—the crazy ones and the ones the city paid. Why did he have to be so near getting killed when he met one he liked? Now that she was showing a little less fear and anger, she was talking straight to him. She was good, but she wasn't acting as if she was too good for him. ""They'll start shooting pretty quick,"" said Lane. "" I'm sorry about you."" ""I wish I could write a letter to my parents,"" she said. [SNIPPET] A predatory excitement rippled through him as he sailed down through the air. It was like going into battle again. A little red-white-and-green flag fluttered on a staff below the window. Whose flag?"
2107,"The general's voice always boomed, he was always hearty, he was always sure that while things might look black right now, they would work out all right in the end. By the time the booming voice reached Zen's earphone, it had been transformed into a tinny squeak. Kurt thought he detected an uneasy note in the squeak and he wondered if the general had finally glimpsed the end, and was finding it not quite as he had supposed. ""In hell, general,"" Zen answered. He swiftly told where he was and what had happened. "" Cuso's blooper knocked out the last pass by which we can bring an effective force against him. This whole area is loaded with radiation."" [SNIPPET] I've got my orders from Wilkerson himself and I'm passing them on to you. Find these new people! Follow that nurse to hell if you have to."" ""Right, sir."" ""Report to me when you have something to report—that is, something besides going to bed with her."
2108,"asked Garvers hopefully. “Nothing that would help a solution at present,” said Max. “ But do you remember the legend of King Tantalus?” “Slightly. [SNIPPET] He has had no technical training, unless you want to count a year of high school [p 62] general science. So he wasn’t too much help in explaining how Duvall’s instrument works. “And, just to make matters more juicy, Duvall kept no notes. He had total recall and a childlike fear of putting anything into writing that had not been experimentally verified.” “And this machine, how is it supposed to work?”"
2109,"I’ll find a way to use them, never fear!”  “But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.  “You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “ All you need is confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.” [SNIPPET] cried Dorothy. “ Are you not a Great Wizard?”  “Hush, my dear,” he said. “ Don’t speak so loud, or you will be overheard—and I should be ruined."
2110,"That'd have world-wide appeal—"" ""Oh, Crockett,"" Travis hissed. Crockett stood up. "" Don't use that tone of voice to me, Billy Travis! [SNIPPET] ""O.K. Put it to a vote of the men outside. Do we stay, and maybe get croaked, or do we fall back and conserve our strength until we need it? Take care of it, eh, Davey?"" Crockett picked up his guitar and went outside. Travis roared, ""This is insubordination!"
2111,NIEMAND. Scores of them. LATHAM. What is your opinion of these correlations? [SNIPPET] NIEMAND. Middletown was immediately struck by the resemblance between the chart of mental disturbance and one he had been plotting over the years from his radio observations. Now when he compared the two charts the resemblance between the two was unmistakable. The pattern shown by the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the solar chart but with this difference.
2112,"And like Job they have usually given up in despair, convinced that the origin of evil is too deep for the human mind to solve. Generally they have concluded that man is inherently wicked and sinful and that is the end of it. Now for the first time science has thrown new light on this subject. LATHAM. How is that? NIEMAND. [SNIPPET] The pattern shown by the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the solar chart but with this difference. The disturbances on the Earth started two days later on the average than the disturbances due to the S-Regions on the Sun. In other words, there was a lag of about forty-eight hours between the two. But otherwise they were almost identical. LATHAM. But if these S-Regions of Middletown's are invisible how could he detect them? NIEMAND."
2113,"You have seen it hidden in her eyes and you have seen it in the milky eyes of the twins. Worse than dead. Dusk became night and finally the doctor came. It had begun to lightning and a few large drops of rain stroked Rush's cheek. Not a good year for the farming he had retreated to. Not a good year for anything. He stood to greet the doctor and the other man with him. [SNIPPET] ""She is the same,"" John Rush said to the doctor. He turned to the other man, keeping his face emotionless, hands at his side. He had expected this for some time. "" I think you will be wanting to look at the twins. They are by her bed."" He opened the door and motioned them in and then followed. He heard the Juvenile man catch his breath a little."
2114,"I'd like to feed in the question, ""What's Life?"" to one of those machines and see what came out. Just figures, I suppose. I read somewhere that if a billion monkeys had typewriters and kept pecking away at them they'd eventually turn out all the Encyclopedia Brittanica in trillions and trillions of years. Well, they've done it all right, and in jig time. [SNIPPET] Sometimes you do get human voices, I'll admit, but they're not like they are in Beethoven's Ninth or Holst's Planets. There's the real sound of the universe (the Professor concluded, shutting the window). That's your heavenly choir. That's the music of the spheres the old alchemists kept listening for—if they'd just stayed around a little longer they'd all have been deafened by it. Oh, to think that Schopenhauer was bothered by the crack of carters' whips! And now it's time for this mouse to tuck himself in his nest in the dynamo. Good night, gentlemen!"
2115,"But we are still too many millions of miles away to know yet. Before you are ready to leave the ship, you will know."" In the months that passed, Adam tried associating more with the other children. He played their games, which seemed to him to be played without a purpose, but they wouldn't or couldn't play his—with one exception. He showed them how to turn off the artificial gravity in the recroom and they became obsessed with the same physical euphoria he had discovered for himself. [SNIPPET] They tried moving everything they saw, but couldn't budge the heavy couch Adam hid behind. Looking for escape, Adam's eyes caught a round metallic handle set flush into the heavy deck carpet. He lifted it and pulled. Nothing happened. He stood up, bracing his feet against the deck and heaved with all his strength."
2116,"It was dead—dead and decaying. He searched the ship. He found storerooms, with cylinders and bales of stuff that looked as if it might possibly be food; he found the engine room, with great piles of outlandishly sculptured metal and winking lights and swinging meter needles. But he was the only living thing on board. The view from all six directions—in the control room telescreens, and in the ship's direct-view ports alike—was exactly the same. [SNIPPET] Weaver shut off the engines again, and waited. The star had planets. He noted their passage in the telescreen, marked their apparent courses, and blithely set himself to land on the one that seemed to be nearest. He was totally ignorant of orbits; he simply centered his planet on the screen as he had done with the star, found that it was receding from him, and began to run it down. He came in too fast the first time—tore through the atmosphere like a lost soul and frantically out again, sweating in the control room's sudden heat. He turned, out in space, and carefully adjusted his speed so that ship and planet drifted softly together."
2117,"They burst through the back of the stage and out a door, like a flood, bearing the poor man with them into a shed, and then out, quite suddenly, into an abandoned gymnasium. ""There it is!"" said someone. "" The rocket."" And then a silence fell that was terrible to entertain. There was the rocket. Mrs. Bellowes looked at it and her hands sagged away from Mr. Thirkell's collar. [SNIPPET] Of course, thought Mrs. Bellowes. Out into space. Out and out, and the darkness like a great church, and the stars like candles, and in spite of everything, Mr. Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we are going toward the Lord. And there, yes, there, as she fell on and on, coming toward her, she could almost discern the outline now, coming toward her was His mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a frightened sparrow. ""I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes,"" she said quietly, in her best company voice. "" I'm from the planet Earth."""
2118,"I’ve rather been expecting you. What is on your mind?” “Seeds! Eggs! Baseballs!” was the reply, “I don’t know what. You’ve seen the latest television reports, I suppose?” [SNIPPET] Jim leaped for the cabin. A touch of the starter and the powerful engine came in. Braking his wheels hard, to hold the plane on the ground, he advanced the throttle as much as he dared, and sent a high-tension current surging through the wires the professor had connected with his tube above. Soon came that high, whining hum they had heard in the laboratory—a thousand times magnified now—and the nib of the big tube glowed a livid, eery green in the lemon dawn. “Joan!” called her father sharply. “ Get in the cabin with Jim!”"
2119,"First it grew by leaps and bounds, then more slowly, then hardly at all. Weaver shut off the engines again, and waited. The star had planets. He noted their passage in the telescreen, marked their apparent courses, and blithely set himself to land on the one that seemed to be nearest. [SNIPPET] Weaver closed his helmet against it; then, remembering that the air in his suit tank would not last forever, he lugged the corpse out to the airlock, closed the inner door on it, and opened the outer one. It was hard for him to accept the obvious explanation of the Aurigean's death, but he finally came to it. He recalled something the guide had said about the Aurigeans' susceptibility to Earthly infections. That must have been it. That had been why the creature had bellowed and run to seal itself off from him. It was all his fault."
2120,"My head seemed suddenly to have become all throat, a great, cavernous, empty throat in which sounds and lights were mingled together, in a swift rhythm, approaching, receding eternally. Then, I think, there were dreams. But I have forgotten them. I began to emerge from the effect of the ether. Everything was dim, but I could perceive Alice beside me, and Sir John. [SNIPPET] The last man. ... I am cold—cold. But is it you, Alice? Is it you?"
2121,"Later it will be possible to make many at a time—fifty, or even a hundred in one month—but for the first two or three months, Master, two weapons in a month is all that Your unworthy servants can do."" ""Very well,"" said Weaver. "" See to it."" He turned and examined the large globe of the planet which stood on His desk. Here was another product of His genius; the Terranovans had scarcely had maps worthy of the name before His Coming. [SNIPPET] Weaver felt tears welling to His eyes, and He restrained Himself from weeping openly only by a gigantic effort. After all, He was a god of wrath; but the love which swept toward Him at this moment was a powerful thing to gainsay. When it was all over, He went back to His sanctum, dismissed all His retinue except His regular assistants, and removed the ceremonial robes. ""The people responded well,"" He said. "" I am pleased."""
2122,"When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery and saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill's summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there. [SNIPPET] This much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarian—the same erudite Henry Armitage (A. M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy."
2123,"He knew there was neither gravity nor lack of it. He knew there was no atmosphere—and he accepted that, not because he accepted the xhindi's word that he would not need to breathe in this continuum, but because he didn't care whether or not he breathed; he didn't care about anything. ""Come,"" the xhindi said, in audible words now, and their spoken voices were as sweet as their mind voices. He found himself moving as through a nightmare, as he proceeded according to their directions, and the xhindi themselves, with their monstrous grace and musical voices, were a logical part of the black ballet in which he found himself participating. The dignitaries of Ferr, a fantasy procession in the moonlit colors of hell—smoke and flame and shadow—came to greet him and to lead him to the mbretersha. [SNIPPET] But she shook her golden head. "" No, nothing like that. I want to go to another system. It's not that I don't want to be where people are. I like crowds. I just want to be where there are different people."" He forced another smile. """
2124,"Breathe in gentle strain, my Lyre! ’ Tis here that Beauty loves to rest: Describe the pangs of fond desire, Which rend a faithful Lover’s breast.  S  In every heart to find a Slave, In every Soul to fix his reign, In bonds to lead the wise and brave, And make the Captives kiss his chain, Such is the power of Love, and Oh! I grieve so well Love’s power to know. In sighs to pass the live-long day, To taste a short and broken sleep, For one dear Object far away, All others scorned, to watch and weep, Such are the pains of Love, and Oh! [SNIPPET] The solitude in which She had passed the Evening, the gloom of night, the Book which She had been reading, and the Room in which She sat, were all calculated to place before her such a vision. He treated the idea of Ghosts with ridicule, and produced strong arguments to prove the fallacy of such a system. His conversation tranquillized and comforted her, but did not convince her. She could not believe that the Spectre had been a mere creature of her imagination; Every circumstance was impressed upon her mind too forcibly, to permit her flattering herself with such an idea. She persisted in asserting that She had really seen her Mother’s Ghost, had heard the period of her dissolution announced and declared that She never should quit her bed alive."
2125,"Finding nothing unusual, a patrolman reported to the first civilian car then returned to wave the farmer on his way. When the widow teacher from the frame house, started for school, she too, was stopped. After a cursory inspection the patrolman passed her on. Two of the three accounted for. What of the third? Quietly a cavalcade formed, converged in Solomon's front yard and parked facing the road ready for quick departure. [SNIPPET] Though sitting, he was propped against the office; a tin shed decorated like a Christmas tree with hundreds of hub caps dangling from sagging wooden rafters. The back door opened on two acres of what Solomon happily agreed was the finest junk in all California. Fords on the left, Chevys on the right, and across the sagging back fence, a collection of honorable sedans whose makers left the business world years ago. They were known as Solomon's ""Classics."""
2126,"Or consistent with the glory of God? I doubt it.""  ""I can think of nothing that would be more so. Is it not consistent with every precept of the Gospel? Come, brother, say that our reconciliation is complete."" [SNIPPET] The woman exclaimed that it was my brother's spirit that stood beside me.  ""Impossible!"" exclaimed the attorney. "" At least, I hope not, else his signature is not worth a pin. There is some balance due on yon business, madam."
2127,"The biologist grimaced. "" I've been shown two hundred and sixteen different samples of rock and dust. I have examined in detail twelve crystal growths which looked vaguely like vegetation. Nothing was alive or contained living things by any standards I could conscientiously set."" [SNIPPET] I For a moment, he thought that the Albireo had been flung bodily into the air. Then he decided that the great metal pillar had merely fallen over. Finally he realized that the ship was still erect, but the ground under it had just tried to leave. Everyone in the group had become so used to the almost perpetual ground tremors that they had ceased to notice them; but this one demanded attention. Rowson, using language which suggested that his career might not have been completely free of adventure after all, flashed through the communication level on his way down to the power section. Schlossberg and Babineau followed, the medic pausing to ask Zaino if he were all right."
2128,"Richard held his peace at this word, but Ralph said: ""I thank thee, Master Clement, for thy love and thy helping hand; and will promise thee to abide thee here eight days at the least; and meanwhile I will ponder the matter well.""      Therewithall they parted after more talk concerning small matters, and Ralph wore through the day, but Richard again did him to wit, that on the morrow he would find his old friends of Swevenham in the Market. And Ralph was come to life again more than he had been since that evil hour in the desert; though hard and hard he deemed it that he should never see his love again.  Now as befalleth young men, he was a good sleeper, and dreamed but seldom, save such light and empty dreams as he might laugh at, if perchance he remembered them by then his raiment was on him in the morning. [SNIPPET] Said the carle: ""I have seen her when I was young and also since I have been old, and ever was she fair and lovely, and slender handed, as straight as a spear, and as sweet as white clover, and gentle-voiced and kind, and dear to our souls.""  ""Yea,"" said Ralph, ""and she doth not dwell in this castle always; where else then doth she dwell?"" "" I wot not,"" said the carle, ""but it should be in heaven: for when she cometh to us all our joys increase in us by the half.""  ""Look you, father,"" said Ralph, ""May it not have been more than one Lady of Abundance that thou hast seen in thy life-days; and that this one that now is, is the daughter's daughter of the one whom thou first sawest—how sayest thou?"" The carle laughed: ""Nay, nay,"" said he, ""It is not so: never has there been another like to her in all ways, in body and voice, and heart and soul."
2129,"The Badger shows evidence of careful and tasteful editorship, combined with a commendable artistic sense in choice of paper and cover.  The leading article, an essay on the minimum wage, is from the pen of the editor, and shows both literary ability and a sound knowledge of economics. "" Sister to the Ox"", by A. W. Ashby, is an excellent short story whose strength is rather in its moral than in its plot. The editorials are certainly not lacking in force, and seem well calculated to stir the average amateur from his torpor of triteness and inanity.  THE INSPIRATION for November is an ""Official Number"", containing the work of none but titled authors. [SNIPPET] The present number is not so ambitious in some respects as many of its predecessors, but it must be said that within a somewhat smaller scope it accomplishes quite as much as a more pretentious issue could hope to do. Nor is the latest Olympian at all in need of any apologies for shortcomings in the way of size, appearance, or general literary quality. Indeed, publications that consist of 12 pages and cover are always certain of a hearty welcome, while the present production of Mr. and Mrs. Cole has qualifications in addition to those just mentioned that recommend it warmly to all readers. The poem, ""Motherhood,"" by Ethelwyn Dithridge is a truly noble and inspired effort. Amateur journalism is fortunate to number a poet of Miss Dithridge's attainments in its ranks."
2130,"""I remember dog, that is the first word I ever learned, but what will I say to them about a dog? I remember house and horse and apple and fish. Oh, now I remember the entire language. But what if I forget it again? Would it not be an odd speech if I could only say apple and fish and house and dog? I would be shamed."" [SNIPPET] He was terrified that the climax of his life's work should find him too craven to accept it. And he discovered that he had forgotten his English again. ""I remember bread and butter, but I don't know which one goes on top. I know pencil and pen-knife and bed, but I have entirely forgotten the word for maternal uncle. I remember plow, but what in the world will I say to all these great men about a plow? I pray that this cup may pass from me."" Then he disintegrated in one abject mass of terror."
2131,"“Well, anyway, he said that Duvall had perfected an invention of great national importance shortly before his death and asked Busch to deliver it to the government if anything should happen to him. Then Duvall died suddenly of a heart attack.” “And what was this invention?” “Isn’t it obvious? [SNIPPET] “Nothing that would help a solution at present,” said Max. “ But do you remember the legend of King Tantalus?” “Slightly. What about it?” “Well … if he were here,” said Max thoughtfully, “he’d … sympathize.”"
2132,"The fact it keeps him in the headlines—well, of course that wouldn't have any bearing. So Pentagon invited him to come to the field here to watch the test, hoping that would win him over."" The general hesitated, then continued. ""I've gone a step farther. I felt if he was actually at the center of control, your operation, he might be won over. If he could actually participate, press the activating key or something, if the headlines could show he was working with us, actually sent the test ship on its flight...."" ""General, you can't,"" Jennings moaned. [SNIPPET] This whole deal could be taken out of the hands of[110] the military on charges of waste and corruption. It could be brought back into the control of private industry, where it belonged. He thought of vast tracts of land in his own state, tracts he could buy cheap, through dummy companies, places which could be made very suitable for the giant factories necessary to manufacture spaceships. As chairman of the appropriations committee, it wouldn't be difficult to sway the choice of site. And all that extra employment for the people of his own state. The voters couldn't forget plain, simple, honest O'Noonan after that! ""Beep, two."""
2133,"""Good, I'd really like to take those pictures,"" Tom said. "" Incidentally, who did the carvings?"" ""We did,"" Jock said. "" Together."" [SNIPPET] He missed Lois and was grateful for the single little girl solemnly skipping rope in a corner and paying no attention to him. The odd lingo she repeated stuck in his mind: ""Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o, Gis-so. Gik-lo, I-o...."" Suddenly the air was filled with soft chimes. """
2134,"He would also want to learn of my safe arrival before preparing himself for another undertaking of the kind; to see each other was therefore necessary. Almos would undoubtedly have warned me of this, had not the cessation of wave contact prevented him from giving me instructions. It was late in the afternoon when a feeling of intense hunger reminded me that I had not tasted food for twenty-four hours. I contented myself, however, with a light meal at a neighboring cafe, knowing the danger of eating heavily at this time. To my great surprise, I found that this small amount of food was evidently all my system required. [SNIPPET] ""I carefully followed your instructions, Almos, regarding the virator, and, half an hour later, I turned off the current of super-radium. I was just preparing to leave. You are late in returning, are you not?"" While Reon thus spoke, I had gained time to glance hastily over the instructions that Almos had written upon the slip of paper which I held in my hand, and I now replied, with every nerve strung in an effort to appear calm: ""I am, Reon, a whole hour late, and very sorry, indeed, to have kept you waiting so long."
2135,"The brain tumor is too large and too inaccessible for treatment or surgery. It will be soon now. I am surprised that she has lasted this long. I am prolonging a sure process."" He turned away. "" That's all I can do."" ""Thank you for coming, doctor—I appreciate that."" [SNIPPET] The thin carven features of the children were emotionless, waiting. He strove for rational meaning within his brain. These are my sons—they can not see or hear or speak. They are identical twins—born with those defects. Take two children, blind them, make them deaf to all sound, cut away their voices. They are identical twins, facing the same environment, sharing the same heredity of blasted chromosomes. They will have intelligence and curiosity that increases as they mature."
2136,"Another great beast now appeared and asked to go along. This was none other than the famous Cowardly Lion, one of the most interesting creatures in all Oz. No lion that roamed the jungles or plains could compare in size or intelligence with this Cowardly Lion, who—like all animals living in Oz—could talk and who talked with more shrewdness and wisdom than many of the people did. He said he was cowardly because he always trembled when he faced danger, but he had faced danger many times and never refused to fight when it was necessary. [SNIPPET] Thank you for coming. If you’ll please let down a rope, I’ll empty this hole in a hurry.”  “How strange!” said Dorothy, greatly disappointed.  “It’s evident the Pink Bear didn’t tell the truth.”"
2137,"Unexpectedly, he spotted the other children. He turned quickly into a room before they saw him and ducked behind the largest of the couches. He was in the aft recroom, he realized, not having paid attention to where he was going. What was it all about? Did Mecfather really mean it when he said the cousins were deeper than the mecs? [SNIPPET] Your parents were the finest the human race could produce—intelligent, strong, healthy, high survival quotient. Is this what you mean by deep?"" ""Partly, but also—feeling. I think I feel things better."" The other children waddled in, took their seats and switched on robomonitors in the ritual of classroom procedure."
2138,"A naked savage raised his head from behind what might, two hundred years ago, have been a cement park-bench, a hundred yards away. Reader Stamford Rawson promptly killed him and began reloading. ""I think you're right, Tenant,"" he said. "" The Scowrers have never attacked in bands like this before. They must have had a powerful reason, and I can think of only one."" ""That's what I'm beginning to think, too,"" Verner Hughes agreed. "" [SNIPPET] ""Start shooting now,"" he said. "" Aim for the upper part of their bodies."" The two auto-loading rifles began to crack. After a few shots, the savages took cover. Evidently they understood the capabilities and limitations of the villagers' flintlocks; this was a terrifying surprise to them. ""Jim!"" Altamont was almost praying into the radio. """
2139,"She is different. ""A part of her will go with us,"" the voice said. "" There is another place that touches this one which we perceive and know more fully than this one."" The voice died away and brief pictures of a land of other dimensions beyond sight flashed in his brain. [SNIPPET] To cast off the world that had already given him all of the hate and fear that he could stand, that had made him worse than a coward. To go with her. But she no longer needed him. She was complete—as they were, only necessary to themselves."
2140,"""Well, he stayed up every night watching them. Some nights he didn't even go to sleep. Even after the set was off, he sat in one of the chairs, just staring at the screen. This morning, when I got up, he wasn't in the house. [SNIPPET] She daintily placed it in her mouth and chewed thoughtfully before she answered. ""I wish I knew. All he does all day long is sit in the backyard and stare at the grass. He insists that he is standing on top of a cliff."" Hanstark took out a small pad and a short ball-point pen. He wrote something down before he spoke again. """
2141,"There was the written history of the Terranovans, which covered minutely a period of nine thousand years—though not completely; there were periods and places which seemed to have left no adequate records of themselves. The natives had no reasonable explanation of this phenomenon; they simply said that the keeping of histories sometimes went out of fashion. Then there was the biology of the Terranovans and the countless other organisms of the planet—simply to catalogue them and give them English names, as he had set out to do, would have occupied him the rest of his lifetime. There was the complex and puzzling field of social relations—here again everything seemed to be in unaccountable flux, even though the over-all pattern remained the same and seemed as rigid as any primitive people's. There was physics, which presented exasperating difficulties of translation; there was engineering, there was medicine, there was economics. When he finally gave it up, it was not so much because of the simple arithmetical impossibility of the job as because he realized that it didn't matter. [SNIPPET] He found storerooms, with cylinders and bales of stuff that looked as if it might possibly be food; he found the engine room, with great piles of outlandishly sculptured metal and winking lights and swinging meter needles. But he was the only living thing on board. The view from all six directions—in the control room telescreens, and in the ship's direct-view ports alike—was exactly the same. The stars, like dandruff on Weaver's blue serge suit."
2142,"“We meet next week,” Massan replied gravely. “You should have refused.” “On what pretext?” “No pretext. A flat refusal, based on the certainty that Odal or someone else from Kerak is tampering with the dueling machine.” Massan shook his head sadly. “ [SNIPPET] A combination of electroencephalograph and autocomputer. A dream machine, that amplified a man’s imagination until he could engulf himself into a world of his own making. Leoh envisioned it as a device to enable men to rid themselves of hostility and tension safely. Through his efforts, and those of his colleagues, dueling machines were quickly becoming accepted as devices for settling disputes."
2143,"""Look at it this way,"" Kane persisted. "" If you carry our corpses to your masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us to the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission later."" A long silence followed. [SNIPPET] I selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. "" A little stronger than our own,"" I informed the machine. We drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at the alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere. He beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised knuckles. ""Please don't hurt yourself,"" the machine pleaded. ""Why?"" Kane screamed at the ceiling. """
2144,"Drowsily his mind wandered from the hotel's android servants ... to the strictly utilitarian mechanical monstrosity at home, known affectionately as ""Old John"" ... to the android showroom where they had seen the one that Dad said looked like Mother. He jolted suddenly, sickeningly awake. Suppose, his mind whispered treacherously, suppose that Dad had ordered one to take Mom's place ... not on Mars, but here while she returned to Mars with him. Suppose that instead of Mom he discovered one of those Things ... or even worse, suppose he went on from day to day not even knowing. It was a bad five minutes; he was wet with perspiration when he lay back on his pillows, a shaky smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He had a secret defense against the Terror. He giggled a little at the thought of what Aunt Bee would say if she knew. [SNIPPET] Tommy relaxed and lay back happily. Anyway, that was the last of Aunt Bee! The next hour or two passed in a flurry of ringing phones, people coming and going, and last-minute words and reminders. Then suddenly it was time to leave. Dad burst in for a last quick hug and a promise to send him pictures of Douwie and her foal, due next month; Mother dropped a hasty kiss on his hair and promised to hurry back from the Spaceport."
2145,"And then she confessed her entire sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep wood.  And he carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches, taught her the psalm criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand which had wielded the axe, and went over the heath.  “Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes!” said she. “ Now I will go into the church that people may see me!” [SNIPPET] I have seen everything and I know everything!”  “Poesy!” cried the learned man. “ Yes, yes, she often dwells a recluse in large cities! Poesy! Yes, I have seen her—a single short moment, but sleep came into my eyes!"
2146,"And she stepped forward. The blue-domed hall that gave directly on the outer air had disappeared since Sherman and Marta Lami had raced out of it on that night that now seemed so long ago. In its place was an enormous tunnel, lined apparently with some metal, for its sides were smooth and shimmering. The portion they entered was lightless, but it curved as it ran down, and around the curve they could see the faint reflection of a light somewhere farther along the passage. Their feet echoed oddly in the enormous silence of the place. [SNIPPET] It would be futile—and impossible—to chronicle all the events of that wild ride; to tell how the light-bombs dropped unceasingly from above; how the driver of one car, blinded by the glare, hurtled his vehicle through the plate-glass window of a store, and how McAllister, the artilleryman, fought off the birds with a huge shard of glass from the window; how the passengers in another car, wrecked by a bomb, got a fire-engine and cleared their way to Times Square with clanging bell and clouds of malodorous fire-extinguisher chemicals; or how Mrs. Roberts decapitated one of the monsters with a single blow of the cleaver she carried. Dawn found them, a depressed group of fourteen, gathered in the protection of the underground passages. ""Well, what next?"" asked Gloria, who seemed to have preserved more of her normal cheerfulness than anyone. "" Do we stay here till they come for us, or do we go get 'em?"""
2147,"Stop taking so much for granted! Before I even scratch where it itches to please you guys, I want to see those kids! And in damned good shape, too!"" Snow held onto my arm and trembled. This was it. Now we'd know for sure if the boys were all right. The Martian looked exasperated, but then he reached an arm out from himself—I couldn't tell exactly, without getting a blinding headache, just which way his arm went, left, right, up or down. [SNIPPET] ""Something for you, buddy?"" I looked up. The bartender, his voice mirroring the polite caution with which people spoke to collapser toters, was down at my end of the bar, by the doorway, his face strained into a nervously hearty anxiety to please. Irritably, I leaned forward to rasp a negation into his face at close range, and then I decided to create no more ruckus than I had to. "" Okay,"" I grunted."
2148,"One was white, and in this lay the Princess; the other was red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for little Kay. She bent back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck. Oh! that was Kay! She called him quite loud by name, held the lamp towards him—the dreams rushed back again into the chamber—he awoke, turned his head, and—it was not little Kay!  The Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young and handsome. [SNIPPET] They were telling each other, with a confidential interchange of ideas, where they had been during the day. The messenger of Fortune had only executed a few unimportant commissions, such as saving a new bonnet from a shower of rain, etc.; but what she had yet to perform was something quite unusual.  “I must tell you,” said she, “that to-day is my birthday; and in honor of it, a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me, which I am to carry to mankind. These shoes possess the property of instantly transporting him who has them on to the place or the period in which he most wishes to be; every wish, as regards time or place, or state of being, will be immediately fulfilled, and so at last man will be happy, here below.”  “Do you seriously believe it?” replied Care, in a severe tone of reproach. “"
2149,"The cloudy surface of Mercury now lay far beneath us, and the glowing disc of the sun, which appeared four or five times larger than it does on the earth, had taken a bluish tinge—a proof that we had reached a very great altitude. ""What a magnificent 'sun-spot!'"" exclaimed the professor in a tone of admiration. "" Just take a peep at it."" I placed my eye to the telescope, and saw the glowing surface of the disc resolved into a marvellous web of shining patches on a dimmer background, and in the midst a large blotch which reminded me of a quarry hole as delineated on the plan of a surveyor. [SNIPPET] The insects are a match for the birds in point of beauty, if not also in size and musical qualities. Many of them are luminescent, and omit steady or flashing lights of every tint all through the night. There are few large quadrupeds in the country, and so far as we could learn none of these are predaceous. We saw an animal resembling a deer on one hand, and a tapir on the other, as well as a kind of toed horse or hipparion, and a number of domestic pets all strange to us. The people, according to their tradition, came originally from a temperate land far across the ocean to the south-east, which is now a dark and frozen desert."
2150,"and hurried at once to the rescue of her overturned people.  ""Oh, Shaggy Man! How could you?"" asked Dorothy, reproachfully. [SNIPPET] ""Of course I cannot read geographys,"" he said.  ""You could take one of the Wizard's School Pills,"" suggested Billina, ""and that would make you learned and wise without studying.""  The crab began laughing again, which so provoked the zebra that he tried to shake the little creature off. This resulted in more ear-pinching, and finally Dorothy told them that if they could not behave they must go back to the forest."
2151,"That barefaced world is not a world at all. It is only a dream. This is the real world."" The lady awoke howling. And she had not howled before, for she was a demure lady. Nor was she the only one who awoke howling. [SNIPPET] Willy said that he had interviewed a thousand people at random. ( He hadn't really; he had talked to about twenty. It takes longer than you might think to interview a thousand people.) He reported that slightly more than sixty-seven per cent had had a dream of the same repulsive world."
2152,"Don't we have plenty of mysterious disappearances as the result of explosions, and particularly, strangely large numbers of missing in a major war?"" My blood chilled. The world was beginning to seem a pretty awful place. Grosnoff saw my disturbance, and placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. ""I'm afraid,"" he said, smiling, ""that I rather yielded to the temptation to get a rise out of you. That suggestion might be unpleasantly true under special circumstances. But I particularly have an eye out for the special capacities of that weird and rare phenomenon, the fire-ball. [SNIPPET] Meantime, Dr. Grosnoff, realizing that his patient could not be kept forever tied in bed, had assisted me in preparing for his permanent care at home. The device was simple; we had just taken his room, remodeled the ceiling as a floor, and fitted it with furniture upside down. Most of the problems involved in this were fairly simple. The matter of a bath rather stumped us for a while, until we hit upon a shower."
2153,"""The crossover for NAT 163 has painting crews working. Might watch out for any crud on the roadway. And they've got the entrance blocked there so that all 163 exchange traffic is being rerouted to 164 west of Chillicothe."" The dispatcher thumbed through his reference sheets. "" [SNIPPET] From the depths of the nightmarish scene came a tortured scream. Kelly reached into a coverall pocket and produced another sedation hypo. She squirmed around and started to slip down into the wreckage with Ferguson. Martin grabbed her arm. "" No, Kelly, this thing's ready to blow. Come on, Clay, get out of there."
2154,"Owing to its great weight this was no easy work, and it would express the procedure better if I said that I placed the crate around the instrument. Making sure that it was all covered carefully, I had it moved to my new quarters and set in place, the impression of the carriers being that it was a painting which I was very anxious that no one should see until it was completed. As it was now within an hour of the time when I expected Mars to appear, I decided to leave my books and other belongings at my former rooms until the next day. I uncovered the instrument, and got everything into readiness, being careful to see that the batteries were all in place, so that nothing might occur to interrupt the long talk with the Martian which I was anticipating. Having turned on the current, and opened the sliding section of the glass roof, I now awaited the appearance of Mars. [SNIPPET] ""Not quite unknown,"" rejoined Almos. "" For lives are sometimes lost in accidents. Instant death defies all our science, and will not be conquered. But in accidents, no matter how serious, where a spark of life remains, we can prevent that from escaping until the body is in a condition to take care of it. ""This is accomplished by a device known as a virator, which, though simple in construction, is the greatest marvel of the age. It consists of a dome, made of material similar to glass in appearance, but which differs from anything else known, in that it is absolutely atomless."
2155,"As far as any of us could see, the Garrity plan was well under way. It wasn't six months before I saw the thing starting off. That was when I was invited to Garrity's second wedding. It was in Terra City, and when he asked me to come down with him for a witness, I assumed it would be the girl he had been busily courting before he went to Serco. [SNIPPET] What's the matter, anyway, Garrity? The Union gets us the best wage scale in any space fleet and you still think girls cost too much? Even the Seranese?"" Garrity kept on looking wise. "" I'm not kidding."
2156,"All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the polarizer will polarize it."" ""That's just supposition,"" Junior said stubbornly. "" The fact is, it isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D."" ""Maybe the polarizer is broken,"" Fred suggested. Grampa snorted. "" Broken-shmoken. [SNIPPET] A missionary takes over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and—"" ""Not now, Grampa,"" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making the grand tour of the cabin. The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them, absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too. ""Rat poison?"""

""Well, then, how about DuQuesne, who was in here yesterday? He's probably next to Seaton."" [SNIPPET] He doesn't think that it can be a foreign country. He has their agents pretty well spotted, and the only one that could fill the bill—you know a man with that description and with the cold nerve to do the job would be apt to be known—was in San Francisco, the time this job was pulled off."" ""The more you talk, the more I am convinced that it was DuQuesne himself,"" declared Seaton, positively. "" He is almost exactly my size and build, is the only man I know of who could do anything with the solution after he got it, and he has nerve enough to do anything."" ""I would like to think it was DuQuesne,"" replied the detective, thoughtfully, ""but I'm afraid we'll have to count him out of it entirely."
2158,"Three or four warriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were flattened—and those who were able, ran. They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to pick up their clubs. [SNIPPET] We were guests of Tomboldo. Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to hear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored the growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with agitated jabbering: ""Wollo—yeeta—vo—vandartch—vandartch! Grr—see—o—see—o—see—o!"""
2159,"He was not only thin but also flat, like a cartoon of a man who had been steamrollered. He was lying on the bed, holding onto the covers, with no more substance to him than a thin piece of paper. Less. Mrs. Burroughs took one of his shoulders between her thumb and forefinger, and I took the other, and we held him up. [SNIPPET] She went inside through the front door to fix dinner. I walked around the house to look at the garden. And the moment I walked past the front of the house, I got the shock of my life. The house disappeared! I was too surprised to stop walking, and a step later I was standing at the back of the house, and it was all there."
2160,"Someone just clipped me!"" The field was silent. The ship lay gleaming in the pink light of dawn that was just blooming over the mountains like a pale flower. The two Venusians stood weeping over the bodies of the Earthlings like onion peelers or two women in a bargain basement. [SNIPPET] THERE! If ""Foo E. Onya"", in the last issue, could use a pseudonym so can I. I read his article, I'M THROUGH, with varying degrees of interest. If an answer were really necessary, it could be found more appropriately in the two words of my title above, than in any words that might follow. And that brings up my first point in my rebuttal— Why is it that people, including the lowly science-fiction fan, (to paraphrase Mr. Onya) always feel it necessary to hide behind a pseudonym when they have something to say which they think will displease someone? I've seen this happen so many times! And, coincidently, why SHOULD Mr. Onya take such pains to be unpleasent in print?"
2161,"""Quite possibly,"" said Lindsay. "" But I haven't actually done a damned thing myself to undermine computer judgment. The mistakes have been made by the so-called experts who have fed their machines inadequate information. Those mistakes were infantile. They suggest some sort of neurosis on the part of the feeders. [SNIPPET] People aren't used to it in a statesman."" ""Too good looking—with this busted beak of mine?"" Lindsay pressed a finger against his nose, which had been broken in youth by a wild pitch. Senator Anderson said, ""The slight irregularity of your nose is just enough to keep you from being too pretty, Lindsay."" He smiled and added, ""You certainly stirred up a cyclotron with your speech this afternoon."
2162,"Across the riven plain, whose cracks were now nearly hidden under the new ash, the black cone towered above the nearer elevations. It was visibly taller than it had been only a few hours before. The fountain from its top was thicker, now jetting straight up as though wind no longer meant a thing to the fiercely driven column of gas and dust. The darkness was not so complete; patches of red and yellow incandescence showed briefly in the pillar, and glowing sparks rather than black cinders rained back on the steep slopes. Far above, a ring of smoke rolled and spread about the column, forming an ever-broadening blanket of opaque cloud above a landscape which had never before been shaded from the sun. Streamers of lightning leaped between cloud and pillar, pillar and mountain, even cloud and ground. [SNIPPET] I should have had someone out here to help me with this. You two go on in. Ren, please get back as soon as you can. I can do the work here; none of this stuff is very heavy."" Zaino hesitated as he swung out of the cab. True, there wasn't too much to be moved, and it wasn't very heavy in Mercury's gravity, and he really should be at the radio; but the thirty-nine-year-old mineralogist was a middle-aged lady by his standards, and shouldn't be allowed to carry heavy packages."
2163,"George got red as fire, and then pale as death. I don't know how they finished the hand, but presently somebody made an excuse, and the game was broken off."" ""Oh, dear! dear! That was cruel! cruel! [SNIPPET] I'm blaming no one. Forgiving sins, I should have known, is not blotting, them out. The blood of Christ only turns them red instead of black. It leaves them in the record. It leaves them in the memory. That day when I blotted my copybook at school, to have had the teacher forgive me ever so kindly would not have made me feel the least bit better so long as the blot was there."
2164,"And you will come because—"" ""Because of what?"" he demanded, more sharply than one should address a queen. ""Because your kqyres will make sure that you do."" The tall, splendidly illuminated being who stood close to her throne bowed as she introduced him: ""This is Lord Njeri, who served as kqyres with the previous captain. He will serve with you."" ""Kqyres? [SNIPPET] I've come for you,"" he told her. She didn't say anything, just looked him up and down. The beautiful blue eyes skillfully appraised his worth as a man and as a customer. Then she smiled and patted the gilded hair that streamed past her bare shoulders to her narrow waist."
2165,"All radio-active elements are evidences of it. The feat consists merely in altering the valence of the atom, changing its electric charge, in other words. What I have done in the present instance is merely to speed up a process nature already had under way, inasmuch as we are dealing with a radio-active substance.” “But what has happened to the by-product of the reaction?” [SNIPPET] At present, let us have a look at the negative already treated.” He lifted the anode from the solution now, removed the negative, and held it up. A smile of satisfaction broke over his face, followed by a shudder. “There you are, Jim!"
2166,"What do you want from them—from us—in return for your help?"" He was speaking to Altamont, rather than to Loudons; it seemed obvious that he believed Altamont to be the leader and Loudons the subordinate. ""Because we're trying to bring back the best things of the Old Times,"" Altamont told him. "" Look; you've had troubles, here. [SNIPPET] ""Did you ever drink coffee, Monty?"" the socio-psychologist asked, getting the cigar drawing to his taste. ""Coffee? No."
2167,"He glanced shyly at the daybed, which would become his, and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back into the hall, back to the worst spot of all by the bathroom door. Gramps missed none of the high drama he had authored and he gave his own familiar role everything he had. Frowning and running his finger along each line, as though he were seeing the will for the first time, he read aloud in a deep portentous monotone, like a bass note on a cathedral organ. ""I, Harold D. Ford, residing in Building 257 of Alden Village, New York City, Connecticut, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my last Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made."" He blew his nose importantly and went on, not missing a word, and repeating many for emphasis—repeating in particular his ever-more-elaborate specifications for a funeral. At the end of these specifications, Gramps was so choked with emotion that Lou thought he might have forgotten why he'd brought out the will in the first place. But Gramps heroically brought his powerful emotions under control and, after erasing for a full minute, began to write and speak at the same time. [SNIPPET] Not another one!"" ""'I do stipulate,'"" read Lou, ""'that all of my property, of whatsoever kind and nature, not be divided, but do devise and bequeath it to be held in common by my issue, without regard for generation, equally, share and share alike.'"" ""Issue?"" said Emerald. Lou included the multitude in a sweep of his hand. "" It means we all own the whole damn shootin' match."" Each eye turned instantly to the bed."
2168,"Let me examine them again. Yes, these eleven are of gold. They are all marked alike, on one side with a roughly-executed figure of a woman's head, with the hair gathered on its summit in a kind of ball. There are also other things on them which I do not understand.""  ""Can you not read the letters?"" I asked.  ""No. [SNIPPET] My attack of illness, although sharp, had passed off so quickly that I confidently looked to complete restoration to my former vigorous state of health in a very short time. Nevertheless, many days went by, and I failed to recover strength, but remained pretty much in that condition of body in which I had quitted the sick-room."
2169,"Half-pay and nothing else, all because they spent everything having a good time."" ""You can do without women, maybe?"" I asked. ""No,"" Garrity admitted. "" I'm a normal man."" [SNIPPET] Neither can Garrity. Hell, he didn't even know she'd done anything! He kissed her good-by at the port gates and went on his way, and she went back to work in the port medical office. As far as any of us could see, the Garrity plan was well under way. It wasn't six months before I saw the thing starting off. That was when I was invited to Garrity's second wedding. It was in Terra City, and when he asked me to come down with him for a witness, I assumed it would be the girl he had been busily courting before he went to Serco."
2170,"I went to the professor of Physics in the University I then attended, and I told him it was a fraud, a huge book of mere nonsense. He looked at me rather pityingly. ""I am afraid, Modevski,"" he said, addressing me by the name I was at the time using, ""I am afraid you do not understand it, that is all. When your mind has broadened, you will. You should apply yourself more carefully to your Physics."" [SNIPPET] I had nothing more to understand. I knew everything I was capable of knowing, and, thenceforth, I could only play wearily with the old ideas. Many things happened in the world. A time came when the East and West, two mighty unified hemispheres, rose up in arms: the civil war of a planet. I recall only chaotic visions of fire and thunder and hell. It was all incomprehensible to me: like a bizarre dream, things happened, people rushed about, but I never knew what they were doing."
2171,"It's only an illusion, he told himself, forcing calm on his unwilling nerves. Only an illusion. But it seemed strangely real. He was watching the Gulf of Mexico. He could see Florida off to his right, and the arching coast of the southeastern United States. He could even make out the Rio Grande River. [SNIPPET] ""Can you hear me?"" The general's voice came muffled through the helmet. ""Yes,"" he said. ""All right. Here we go."
2172,"It seemed strange to them indeed that Kress should have come back to land on the roof of the two who had promised to follow him into the stratosphere if he didn't return. Very strange indeed. He had returned, though, releasing Jeter and Eyer from their promise. Strangely enough that fact made them all the more determined to go. And while the newspaper reporters went wild over Kress' return, the partners started making additional plans. [SNIPPET] ""Then you think the same thing I do?"" said Hadley. "" If that is so, can't you start to-morrow? God knows what may happen if we delay longer—though what two of you can do against something which appears to blanket the earth, and strikes from the heavens, I don't know. And yet, the fate of your country may be in your hands."" ""We realize that,"" said Jeter, while Eyer nodded. Hadley opened his mouth to make some other observation, then closed it again, tightly, as a horrible thing happened."
2173,"Good-night."" Their hands touched in the darkness, and the thrill that went over him told a truth of which he had been only vaguely conscious. The power of it made him exultant. Yet when he thought of her and her too quiet affection for him it left him despondent.  Something bumped against the side of the ship and a grating sound followed. Then came other gentle thuds combined with the soft swish of water disturbed. [SNIPPET] One day he implored the faithful Bragdon to steal the Boston terriers. He could not and would not sell them and he dared not give them away. Bragdon dejectedly appropriated the dogs and Brewster announced that some day he would offer a reward for their return and ""no questions asked.""  He took a suite of rooms in a small hotel and was feverishly planning the overthrow of the last torturing thousands. Bragdon lived with him and the ""Little Sons of the Rich"" stood loyally ready to help him when he uttered the first cry of want. But even this establishment had to be abandoned at last."
2174,"We'll use the tractor any way we can think of. Unfortunately it has no plow attachment, and I can't think of anything aboard which could be turned into one. You have shovels, such as they are. The ash is light, especially here, but there's a mile and a half of dam to be built. I don't see how it can possibly be done ... but it's going to be."" ""Come on, Arnie! You're young and strong,"" came the voice of the mineralogist. "" [SNIPPET] ""Zaino, tell all the tractors there'll be no answer from the ship for a while, because no one will be aboard. Then suit up and come outside."" He was gone. Ten minutes later, six human beings and a tractor were assembled in the flame-lit near-darkness outside the ship. The cloud had spread to the horizon, and the sun was gone. Burkett and Hargedon had arrived, but Rowson wasted no time on congratulations. ""We have work to do."
2175,"Time was closing in on them, too. By tomorrow the Nathians could have the government completely under control. It was warm beside the lake. There were purple and orange flowers above the grassy bank. Small creatures flitted and cheeped in the brush and trees. There was a groomis in the reeds at the lower end of the lake, and every now and then it honked like an old man clearing his throat. ""When we girls were all at home we used to picnic here every Eight-day,"" said Diana. [SNIPPET] ""Let's save the noble act for someone who doesn't know you,"" said Orne. "" You've a job for me. O.K. You've made the gesture for your conscience."" Stetson produced a wolfish grin. """
2176,"Browny-red hair that always looked a little carelessly cut. As I said, nothing at all special. It was just something about her. She could have had her pick and she picked Garrity. And only Lane broke the rules and told her. Trouble is, he told her a couple of weeks too late. [SNIPPET] Each one of them gets a share of Garrity's pay—a big share, from the looks of it. Each one of them keeps a nice place for Garrity and, when he comes into port, he eats and sleeps as well as any honest groundwalker. And each one of them has a small fat baby boy, of whose exact age Garrity never seems to be quite sure. Two or three of the kids seem extremely advanced for their ages and they were all born fairly close together, which was enough to make Garrity as proud as a rooster. And Garrity seems to be the only one who can't tell. Thinking about it might make a man want to rush off to Serco and find a girl like Katha ... and Serco is full of them."
2177,"Not that we thought it had a good chance of working, but none of us had a better idea. I guess you know the rest of the story, about how that destroyer spotted us and got us and my diary aboard, and towed the rocket to San Francisco. News of the ""captured Martian"" leaked out, and we all became nine-day wonders until the dismantling of the rocket. Kroger says he must have dissolved in the water, and wonders what that would do. There are about a thousand of those crystal-scales on a Martian. So last week we found out, when those red-scaled things began clambering out of the sea on every coastal region on Earth. [SNIPPET] Lloyd went away then, but the interview wasn't wasted. I learned that he is tall and does have a freckled face. Maybe we can build a chessboard. With my paper and his ballpoint pen and ruler, it should be easy. Don't know what we'll use for pieces, though."
2178,"Red was glad to. He said, ""Now what's biting you?"" ""One of them's got something on him that looks like it might be iron or something."" ""Where?"" ""Right there. I saw it before but I thought it was just part of him. But if he's 'people,' maybe it's a disintegrator gun."" [SNIPPET] said the Astronomer, bitterly. "" There's nothing left. There'll be no second landing. This ship detected life on our planet through accident. Other exploring parties would come no closer than necessary to establish the fact that there were no super-dense worlds existing in our solar system."" ""Well, there's no quarreling with a crash landing."" ""The ship hardly seems damaged."
2179,"His deep-set eyes held me ... his face was pale and had a serenity born of suffering. A placcid face, not given to emotional betrayels, yet mystical. I sat down again. Here was someone bewilderingly strange. Someone I wouldn't soon forget. He moved a hand toward me, as tho to hold me from going, and I saw with mild curiosity that he wore heavy gloves, like mittens. [SNIPPET] BWOM! "" Someone just clipped me!"" The field was silent. The ship lay gleaming in the pink light of dawn that was just blooming over the mountains like a pale flower. The two Venusians stood weeping over the bodies of the Earthlings like onion peelers or two women in a bargain basement. One Venusian looked at the other Venusian, and in a high-pitched, hoarse, sad voice said: ""Aye, aye, aye—THIS—HIT SHOODEN HEPPEN TO A DOG—NOT A DOIDY LEEDLE DOG!"""
2180,"Let's go rabbit hunting."" Car 56 moved slowly out into the police lane. Both troopers had their individual sets of video monitors on in front of their seats and were watching them intently. In the growing light of day, a white-topped car was going to be easy to spot. It had all the earmarks of being another wintery, overcast day. The outside temperature at 0800 was right on the twenty-nine-degree mark and the threat of more snow remained in the air. The 0800 density reports from St. Louis Control were below the 14,000 mark in all lanes in the one-hundred-mile block west of the city. [SNIPPET] A crumpled body lay on the pavement twenty feet from the biggest clump of smashed metal, and other fragments of vehicles were strung out down the roadway for fifty feet. There was no movement. NorCon thruway laws were strict and none were more rigidly enforced than the regulation that no one other than a member of the patrol set foot outside of their vehicle while on any thruway traffic lane. This meant not giving any assistance whatsoever to accident victims. The ruling had been called inhuman, monstrous, unthinkable, and lawmakers in the three nations of the compact had forced NorCon to revoke the rule in the early days of the thruways. After speeding cars and cargo carriers had cut down twice as many do-gooders on foot at accident scenes than the accidents themselves caused, the law was reinstated. The lives of the many were more vital than the lives of a few."
2181,"It could mean my head—"" Suddenly, Ord's head was erect, and the old, clear light was in his blue eyes. "" Now I understand!"" he shouted. "" I thought Travis was raving back there, before he shot himself—and your talk of the Emperor! American respect for Indian rights! Jeffersonian form of government! [SNIPPET] ravis stopped reading, looked up. "" Wonderful! Wonderful!"" Ord breathed. "" The greatest words of defiance ever written in the English tongue—and so much more literate than that chap at Bascogne."" ""You mean to send that?"" Jim gasped."
2182,"You were right about a killing that could be traced to me being bad for my carefully-built reputation. Well now, about your working for me. You said you knew something about the entertainment business. What can you do?"" ""Well, I can't sing or posture, and I'm not much good at acrobatics. I can whistle a little, and...."" [SNIPPET] ""Sure, plenty."" And while one of the men went to the storeroom, the other asked Hanlon if he would like a cup of coffee. ""Gee, I sure would. That's another thing these folks don't have."
2183,"Vyrko smiled. "" Twins, I told you. It runs in my family—no less than one pair to a generation. And I think that's it—Holt's already planted the fact of my having a twin named Vrist, even though he doesn't come into the action."" [SNIPPET] He absently left the sentence unfinished and switched on the video screen. He had to try a dozen channels before he found one that was still casting. When every erg of a man's energy goes to drawing his next breath, he cannot tend his machine. At last Kirth-Labbery picked up a Nyork newscast. The announcer was sneezing badly (""The older literature,"" Vyrko observed, ""found sneezing comic....""), but still contriving to speak, and somewhere a group of technicians must have had partial control of themselves. ""Four hundred and seventy-two planes have crashed,"" the announcer said, ""in the past forty-eight hours. Civil authorities have forbidden further plane travel indefinitely because of the danger of spasms at the controls, and it is rumored that all vehicular transport whatsoever is to come under the same ban."
2184,"Now hast thou the wages thou long hast earned!” said he; and so departed from the damsel.    Then for two days he rode in a great forest, and had but scanty food and lodging, and on the third day he rode over a long bridge, when suddenly there started up a passing foul churl, and smote his horse across the nose, so that he started and turned back, rearing with pain. “ [SNIPPET] Thou shalt die,” said Sir Gawain, “for slaying my hounds.”  “I will make thee all amends within my power,” replied the knight.  But Sir Gawain would have no mercy, and unlaced his helm to strike his head off; and so blind was he with rage, that he saw not where a lady ran out from her chamber and fell down upon his enemy. And making a fierce blow at him, he smote off by mischance the lady’s head."
2185,"Very rich. ""[Pg 11] ""That'll make no real difference,"" Hoskins went on. "" Temperature, about normal for an early summer back home ... looks as if there's a fiendish plot afoot here to make things easy for us."" [SNIPPET] You'd tell him there was nothing there. You'd prove there wasn't."" ""So I would,"" agreed the doctor. "" But in our case I couldn't do anything of the kind. Johnny broke over machines that really didn't work. Hoskins broke over phenomena that couldn't be measured nor understood. Ives broke over things that scuttled and crawled."
2186,"I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit. Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was fishy and glassy—a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. [SNIPPET] It was our design to sit up together till very late, and then watch singly till dawn in two-hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; the inactive member resting on the cot. The natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments from the laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armory, and instinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvelous commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of eighty-one. Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he had preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would be here in full vigor today. Only two persons suspected what did happen—Carrington Harris and myself."
2187,"He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a sack of tobacco and some paper. Holding a piece of paper in one hand, he carefully poured a little tobacco onto it. In one quick movement he rolled the paper and tobacco into a perfect cylinder. He put the sack of tobacco and paper back into his pocket and took out a wooden kitchen match. He scraped it to life on the sole of his shoe and applied the flame to the tip of the cigarette. [SNIPPET] I shall be, Mrs. Nest."" He walked out the door and down three concrete steps. Looking a little to his right, he saw a man squatted on his heels. He walked up to the man. "" You are Mr. Christopher Nest?"" The man looked up and stared for a moment at Hanstark. """
2188,"Then the motor coughed, coughed again, and broke into a steady roaring. The plane moved forward. Its tail swung around. Its wheels headed for the door. They dropped through, into the faces of the foremost pursuers, all of whom were thus effectually blocked off. [SNIPPET] But Kress did not return; nor, so far as the world knew, did any or all of his great airplane. The world itself began to have a feeling of dread—that grew. Franz Kress had been gone a week, when all the world knew that he couldn't possibly have stayed aloft that length of time. Yet no word was received from him, no report received from any part of the world that he had returned. Various islands which he might have reached were scoured for traces of him. The lighter vessels of most of the navies of the world joined in the search to no avail."
2189,"Solomon couldn't help but think, ""The newspapers said scientists were losing rockets and space capsules, so a few old cars could get lost in the clouds without hurting anything."" Early the next morning, he towed the oldest hulk, an Essex, to the cleared space. Manifolds from junk engines were bolted to the wheels but this time carburetor flanges were covered by wooden shingles because Solomon figured he couldn't afford to ruin four salable hub caps just to get rid of his old sedans. Each shingle was taped in place so they could be pulled off in unison with a strong pull on the twine. The tired Essex was pretty big, so Solomon waited until bedtime before stumbling through the dark to the launching pad in his yard. Light from kitchen matches helped collect the shingle cords as he crouched behind the Ford wagon. He held the cords in one calloused hand, a burning match in the other so he could watch the Essex. [SNIPPET] He moved his tray of tools away and trailed the hub cap twine behind the solid body of a big old Ford station wagon. He'd read of scientists in block houses when they shot rockets and was taking no chances. Excitement glistened Solomon's old eyes as what blood pressure there was rose a point or two with happy thoughts. If his idea worked, he would be free of the old cars, yet not destroy a single one. Squatting behind the station wagon, to watch the engine, Solomon gingerly pulled the twine to eliminate slack. As it tightened, he tensed, braced himself with a free hand on the wagon's bumper, and taking a deep breath, jerked the cord. Tired legs failed and Solomon slipped backward when the hub cap broke free of the tape and sailed through the air to clang against the wagon's fender."
2190,"He takes hold of the fetters to unlock them.) MARGARET (on her knees) Who, headsman! unto thee such power Over me could give? [SNIPPET] the echoes first that rang! I bring the unknown multitude my treasures; Their very plaudits give my heart a pang, And those beside, whose joy my Song so flattered, If still they live, wide through the world are scattered. And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning For that serene and solemn Spirit-Land: My song, to faint Aeolian murmurs turning, Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned. I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning, And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned. What I possess, I see far distant lying, And what I lost, grows real and undying."
2191,"Snow raised her eyebrows appraisingly. "" Hmmm. I'll have to remember that in the future."" It was in fun, but I caught a tinge of serious consideration in it. It gave me an uneasy feeling, a feeling that brought me sharply back to my main query, from which I'd been sidetracked a few moments before. ""But you still haven't told me why you came in here."" [SNIPPET] Needless to say, I was feeling pretty chipper as I entered the hangar housing Phobos II. At the moment, I was the most influential human being in the known universe. The pilot, as per my videophoned request, was waiting there for me. I saw him as I stepped into the cool shadows of the building from the hot yellow sunlight outside. He was tall, much taller than I, but he seemed nervous as hell."
2192,"Look, there goes one,"" the younger cried as a large dark object majestically rose into the sky and rapidly disappeared into high clouds. ""Yup, maybe so,"" said the other. "" But it's flying too high for us."" ""I must be a silly old man,"" Solomon thought, scanning the cleared space behind his tow truck where he remembered an engine. There was nothing there, and as Solomon now figured it, never had been. [SNIPPET] Not another word did he say. Heading back to the car parked outside Solomon's office, his footsteps were echoed by those of a crestfallen boy. Solomon, a figure of lonely dejection in the gloom overshadowing his unloved old cars, was troubled with smog causing his eyes to water as tired feet aimlessly found their way back to his seat in the sun. That night, to take his mind off worrisome old cars, Solomon began reading the previous Sunday's newspaper. There were pictures of moon shots, rockets and astronauts, which started Solomon to thinking; ""So, my classics are good only for shooting at the moon."
2193,"Whatever had happened to him, he seemingly in part had anticipated. And now the partners would go up, too, seeking information—perhaps to vanish as Kress had vanished. They were not afraid. They shared the world's feeling of dread, but they were not afraid. Of course death would end their labors, but there were many scientists in the world to take up where they might leave off. There were, for example, Sitsumi of Japan, rumored discoverer of a substance capable of bending light rays about itself to render itself invisible; Wang Li, Liao Wu, Yung Chan, of China—three who had degrees from the world's greatest universities and had added miraculously to the store of knowledge by their own inspired research. [SNIPPET] What did you want with me?"" ""Only to tell you of another strange news dispatch. It gives no details. It merely tells of strange activity around Lake Baikal, beyond the Gobi Desert."
2194,"The flow of super-radium has conveyed the spirit of the patient from the small chamber above and released it in the body as it returned, in exactly the same manner as it does with light-waves or sound-waves."" ""Marvelous!"" I gasped, though my mind could only slowly comprehend this almost miraculous achievement. With such vast scientific resources nothing seemed impossible to Martians. Almos had stopped abruptly. A change came over him. His face paled and his lips set in a hard, determined expression. [SNIPPET] This note I placed with my papers. Returning to the instrument, I discovered that Mars was already visible. Quickly turning on the current and finding no responsive glow, I knew that Almos was already making the preparations he had described to me. He had said that within half an hour the clockwork would turn on the current, and the glow of my instrument would be the signal for my departure. No time was to be lost. Securely fastening the door of my room, I prepared the cone of chloroform and extinguished the light, in order not to excite the suspicion of a chance caller during the evening."
2195,"Had you not, long since, demonstration That ghosts can't stand on ordinary foundation? And now you even dance, like one of us! THE FAIR ONE (dancing) Why does he come, then, to our ball? FAUST (dancing) O, everywhere on him you fall! When others dance, he weighs the matter: If he can't every step bechatter, Then 'tis the same as were the step not made; But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed. [SNIPPET] Then let thyself be taught, say I! Go, league thyself with a poet, Give the rein to his imagination, Then wear the crown, and show it, Of the qualities of his creation,— The courage of the lion's breed, The wild stag's speed, The Italian's fiery blood, The North's firm fortitude! Let him find for thee the secret tether That binds the Noble and Mean together. And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure To love by rule, and hate by measure!"
2196,"Damn, weak-kneed kid! How had he ever gotten so far? ""We should have set up his bubb first, put him inside, and spun it to kill that sense of fall!"" Gimp said. "" We'll do it, now! [SNIPPET] Reckless Ramos, who went tearing around the country in an ancient motor scooter, decorated with squirrel tails and gaudy bosses, would hardly be disturbed by any risky thing he wanted to do. The thumbtacked pictures of the systems of far, cold Jupiter and Saturn—Saturn still unapproached, except by small, instrumented rockets—would be the things to appeal to him. The Kuzak twins stood alertly, as if an extra special homecoming football game was in prospect. But they weren't given to real doubts, either. From their previous remarks it was clear that the asteroids, those fragments of an exploded and once populated world, orbiting out beyond Mars, would be for them. Osmium, iridium, uranium. The rich, metallic guts of a planet exposed for easy mining."
2197,"Was the whole thing then a delusion of an overwrought mind? I stood staring at the instrument in amazement. The Martian, now seeing by my actions that his voice had been heard, raised his instrument and repeated his greeting. The voice rang as clearly as before; there could be no further doubt; through this wonderful instrument the Martian's voice was projected, almost instantaneously to the Earth—millions of miles in a second. The mysterious power which enabled the Martian to project the waves, compared with our electricity as the telegraph does with the stage-coach. Was it strange that I stood aghast, as my mind slowly comprehended the enormous distance which that voice had traversed almost instantaneously? It was some moments before my amazement permitted me to respond to this extraordinary salutation, then—my mind still too bewildered properly to grasp the situation—I mumbled something in English about my great astonishment at hearing a language of Earth spoken from a distant world. [SNIPPET] ""Indeed it would,"" I exclaimed, with rising curiosity. ""Well then,"" rejoined Almos, bringing one of the books and turning over the leaves, while a curious smile still played about his mouth, ""you must understand that this was written over a hundred years before super-radium was discovered, and at that time we had no means of observing Earth except through the telescope, which showed us the mountains, seas, and continents, much the same as your telescope must reveal the physical features of Mars. On the question of whether Earth is inhabited the author says: ""'That this planet is inhabited we have no reason to doubt, as it is known to be enveloped in an atmosphere, and it is now a generally accepted theory that the changes noticed in its color throughout the year are the seasonal effects on vegetable matter existing on its surface.... What the inhabitants are like, however, we can only surmise, but a study of the conditions under which they live will help us to picture the wild amphibious creatures they must be."
2198,"He's in town for the big parade right now."" ""Look, we can't tell you who the donor will be. It's against the law, remember?"" Turner quoted the rule, ""Under Section 48b, single females may bear children if they wish, when authorized by law, but are not allowed to pick the donor. He must remain anonymous. [SNIPPET] ""You'd never understand and I haven't time to tell you. What I want to know is, who gave you the right to use my name in this silly Mother America contest. And you,"" she turned on the Dee Lish agent, ""quit gawping at me. I'm not going to blast off."
2199,"I was affluent. I was respected. I was in control of my environment. And I could aid my friends, of whom I had now acquired an astonishing number. Moreover, my old space-ineptitude sickness had left me. [SNIPPET] I'll cave in its blasted head."" ""That's its tail."" ""It's its head. It's the end it talks with."""
2200,"Ash Parker had not fled. Now he spoke, sounding awed, ""Jeez, Mr. Dukas. I didn't believe it. Maybe my folks can come back, too."" ""Your parents will come back,"" Jack Dukas affirmed. "" I am the first 'memory man' to be resurrected. Among those killed who had had their bodies and minds recorded as was recommended, about a hundred thousand are alive again, as I think you know. [SNIPPET] Granger's, maybe. There were ways for him to have learned a nickname. Many people might admire Granger as much as others despised him. And it was hard to say what he might do, or when. Or how, for that matter. He was clever. And wrong."
2201,"Dozens of Yandor's friends stopped him and complimented him—though somewhat jealously—upon his acquisition, which made him prouder than ever. For Ebony created such a sensation that it took Yandor nearly an hour longer than usual to get to his office. He had not yet reached there, in fact, when Hanlon was surprised and a little nettled by a knock on his apartment door. Somewhat angrily he got up off the bed, and went and opened it. A native was standing there, grinning. ""What d'you want?"" [SNIPPET] ""Just beginning their real introduction to scientific and mechanical technologies on a planetary scale, eh?"" ""That's it. Their system was discovered and mapped a few years ago. The Colonial Board immediately sent psychologists and linguists there to learn their language and study the natives and their form of government, their economics and general advancement. What they found, although far different from our own, was so surprisingly high that we sent them a formal offer to join the Federation. But ..."" he stopped, frowning. ""Yes?"""
2202,"""I hain't so sure,"" he answered. "" He's a puzzler."" The rest of the watch passed away quietly; and at eight bells I made haste to turn-in, for I was tremendously tired. When we were called again for the four to eight watch on deck, I learnt that one of the men in the Mate's watch had seen a light, soon after we had gone below, and had reported it, only for it to disappear immediately. This, I found, had happened twice, and the Mate had got so wild (being under the impression that the man was playing the fool) that he had nearly came to blows with him—finally ordering him off the look-out, and sending another man up in his place. [SNIPPET] Then he turned to the First Mate. ""You will take charge of the deck, Mr. Grainge, while we're aloft,"" he said. ""i, i, Sir,"" the Mate answered and sung out to one of his 'prentices to take the blue-light box back into the cabin. The Old Man turned and led the way forrard. As we went, the light from the two lanterns shone upon the decks, showing the litter of the t'gallant gear. The ropes were foul of one another in a regular ""bunch o' buffers[1]."""

But what is this super-female gag anyway?"" ""Some women have more female sex genes than others. [SNIPPET] The parade was over. Now, as they waited for the banquet and the speeches to begin, John Harmon spoke to Turner. ""You're a lucky man, George."" ""Why?"" ""Spending so much time with Gloria. She had me laughing all the way up Wall Street with her remarks about the parade. If I didn't have to go back to the base tomorrow I'd steal her for a date."""
2204,"You need oil. Stick around."" He disappeared into the bowels of the apartment, the sound of his footsteps ringing enormous in the vast silence. In an instant he was back with a radio battery in one hand and an oil-can in the other. ""Sorry, no grease on tap,"" he remarked briskly. "" Typewriter oil."" He went to work busily, squirting drops of oil into Lee's new metallic joints. "" [SNIPPET] To his surprise, there seemed no attempt to force his mind. The thought leaped up, unbidden, ""Why, this—this Lassan is friendly!"" No definite image or plan or connection of ideas formed itself in his brain; he merely felt enormously soothed and strengthened. After all, he found himself arguing, nobody desired to hurt him; merely to discover what curious process of thought had led him to act as he had. ""You are too intelligent, too high a type to have been put to work at the machines,"" came the unspoken thought of the Lassan. "" We might better have put you at the controls of one of the fighting machines."" ("
2205,"It took me years on Earth to get used to all this water around, it seemed unnatural and dangerous to have it all lying loose that way, but now I shall miss even the Sea. The reason we have this long suspense over Finals is that they will not use Reading Machines to mark the papers for fear of cutting down critical judgement; so each paper has to be read word by word by three Examiners and there are forty-three of us and we wrote six papers each. What I think is I am sorry for the Examiners, but B says they were the ones who set the papers and it serves them perfectly right. I express surprise because D. J. M'Clare our Professor is one of them, but B says He is one of the greatest men in the galaxy, of course, but she gave up thinking him perfect years ago.

2206,"He heard me and, as the object wavered about in the comparative calm under the tree, drifting closer to him, started to obey. But it suddenly approached his face, and seized with a reckless terror, he snatched off his hat and batted at it as one would at a pestilent bee. Instantly there was a blinding glare, a stunning detonation, and a violent air-wave which threw me clear off my feet and to the ground. I sat up blindly with my vision full of opalescent lights and my ears ringing, unable to hear, see, or think. Slowly my senses came back; I saw Alice struggling upright in the grass before me. She cast a quick glance toward the tree, then, still on her knees, covered her face and shuddered. For a long time, it seemed, I gazed toward the tree without sight conveying any mental effect whatever. [SNIPPET] ""Please bear in mind, Jim, that we are not talking about electricity as now handled by man, but about some form of it as yet hypothetical. We don't know what kind of insulation it would require. We may be constitutionally insulated."" ""And you think the fire-ball broke down that insulation by the shock to Tristan's system?"" I asked."
2207,"Hector said nothing. “I intend,” Leoh said firmly, “to assist the staff in monitoring this duel. Your aides may, of course, sit at the control board with me.” Odal nodded. “If you are ready to begin, gentlemen,” the chief meditech said. [SNIPPET] What do you mean by interrupting my first visit home in fifteen years?” “It won’t be a long interruption,” Leoh said. “You told my chief of staff that it was urgent,” Sir Harold groused. “It is. But it’s not the sort of problem that requires much action on your part."

Even if we did only tip him, I'll bet we hurt him plenty."" ""All I've got to say,"" replied Sherman, ""is that I'm glad we're made of metal instead of flesh and blood. If that infra-sound ray had hit us before, we'd be mashed potatoes in that field down there. No wonder the signal station went out so quick."" ""Do we go back and take another whack at them?"" asked Murray Lee."
2209,"“I will still hope that it is not a real bird,” said the Princess.  “Yes, it is a real bird,” said those who had brought it. “ Well then let the bird fly,” said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the Prince.  However, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and black; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door.  “Good day to my lord, the Emperor!” [SNIPPET] Have you not met them anywhere?”  The swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked musing, nodded his head, and said, “Yes; I think I know; I met many ships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent masts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir. I may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most majestically!”  “Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea!"
2210,"The spirit of poetry is driven away by the spirit of science, just as Eros fled before the curiosity of Psyche. How can I enjoy the perfume of a rose if I am thinking of its cellular tissue? I grow blind to the beauty of the Venus de Medicis when I measure its dimensions, or analyse its marble. What do I care for the drama if I am bent on going behind the scenes and examining the stage machinery? [SNIPPET] cried the inventor, ""now let go,"" and sure enough, the box rose steadily upwards until it came within his grasp. "" I am going to send it down to you again,"" he continued, and I expected to see it drop like a stone to the ground; but, strange to say, it circled gracefully through the air in a spiral curve, and landed gently at my feet. ""You see I have entire control over it,"" said Mr. Carmichael, rejoining me; ""but all you have seen has taken place in air, and you might, therefore, suppose that I have an air propellor inside, and that air is necessary to react against it, like water against the screw of a steamboat, in order to produce the motion. I will now show you that air is not required, and that my locomotive works quite as well in a vacuum."" So saying, he put the model under a large bell-jar, from which he exhausted the air with a pump; and even then it moved about with as much alacrity and freedom as it had done in the atmosphere. I confess that I was still haunted by a lingering suspicion of the machine and its inventor; but this experiment went far to destroy it."
2211,"""They've been good years,"" he remarked, apparently to the olive. There was something wrong with this evening. No bounce. No yumph. "" That's a funny tense,"" Manning confided to her own olive. "" Aren't they still good years?"" [SNIPPET] Oh, then we'll know—"" ""We'll know everything. We'll know what the yellow bands are and what becomes of them and what happens to mankind and—"" ""—and we'll know,"" said Lavra, ""whether it's a boy or a girl."" Vyrko smiled. "" Twins, I told you. It runs in my family—no less than one pair to a generation."
2212,"Somewhere out there, somewhere hunted, but not found, the plumbers gathered. There had been a man—what was his name? Masser—that was it. He had been working on a way to inhibit radioactivity—speed up the half-life until they had taken the grant away. If a man can do whatever he thinks of—can he undo that which he has done? Masser was the theoreticist—I was the applier, the one who translated equations into cold blueprints. And I was good until they . [SNIPPET] Not a good year for the farming he had retreated to. Not a good year for anything."""
2213,"There is no need to draw out the tale. Already my hand wavers, and my time grows short. Soon there will be no more of me, no more of my tale—no more of Mankind. There will be only the snow, and the ice, and the cold . Three days later I entered John's Hospital with Alice on my arm. All my affairs—and they were few enough—were in order. I had insisted that Alice wait until I had come safely through the operation, before she submitted to it. [SNIPPET] She would only say that they had gone away for a day or two. And then, on the third day, I found out. They thought I was asleep. The night nurse had just come in to relieve the other. ""Has he been asking about them again?"""
2214,"He laughed as he stepped into his bath. Why should the disseizin of his soul have seemed shameful to him? He had had no soul till it passed out of his keeping. His body thrilled to the cold water, his soul as to a new sacrament. [SNIPPET] “Ever since,” she faltered, “ever since you came to engage the rooms.”  “You are not, of course, given to idolising any tenant of your mother’s?”  “No.”  “May I boast myself the first possessor of your heart?”  “Yes.” She had become very pale now, and was trembling painfully.  “And may I assume that your love for me has been entirely disinterested?."
2215,"Felipe ""Flip"" Villa asked, ""With salt, Joe?"" Major Barris sighed. "" No use trying to tell you space chicks anything. You're lieutenants now, and a lieutenant has the thickest skull of any rank, no matter what service he belongs to."" [SNIPPET] Its stern tubes flamed, then its steering tubes. It was going to drive directly at the asteroid without making a long run! Rip estimated quickly and realized that the Connie would get to the asteroid at the same time that he reached the cave—if he made it. He speeded up as fast as he dared. With little gravity on the asteroid, he couldn't fall, but a false step could lift him into space and make him lose time while he got out an air bottle to propel him down again. The thought gave him an idea."
2216,"The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted it out. ""You're through,"" he said to it silently. "" I've had the experience before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously couldn't be. Or maybe—"" he grinned a little wryly—""maybe I'd almost get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel porcupine quills. No, thanks."" [SNIPPET] Just at that moment, the power came back to him that made everything feverishly real, expanding his center of attention to his visual horizons, and this time it was only a prelude, for a second gateway opened behind the first—a window into all human hearts and minds, the power of human insight fantastically sharpened and enlarged. He could ""read minds,"" or at least he knew the motives—the core of values and consciousness—of any person he cared to look at. Most especially, he knew the motives of Verna and Vivian almost as if he were them. The big thing about Vivian was her fear—no, her conviction, that she wasn't attractive. Every glance her way knocked a hole in the armor of artificial attractiveness she built around herself, and all the hours she devoted to perfecting it, even the desperate worship she lavished on her body, were all utterly lost."
2217,"Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze and adream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older, half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm! [SNIPPET] The child’s dismissed his school.”  She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. “ But aren’t they all—?”  “Sent home—yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at all.”"
2218,"It's got me goin', all right. But I can't think like me about this sorta thing. I got to think like the audience does—or go outa business!"" After which solid but unprofitable lesson in psychology, we dropped the last vestige of pride and tried a circus sideshow. But the results were similar. ""Nah, the rubes don't wear celluloid collars any more. [SNIPPET] Audiences, he explained, were off levitation acts. Too old. No matter what you did, they'd lay it to concealed wires, and yawn. Even if you called a committee from the audience, the committee itself would merely be sore at not being able to solve the trick; the audience would consider the committee a fake or merely dumb. And all that would take too much time for an act of that kind. ""Oh, yeh, I know!"
2219,"I now opened his waistcoat, took the diamond from the inner pocket in which he had placed it, and removed him to the bed, on which I laid him so that his feet hung down over the edge. I had possessed myself of the Malay creese, which I held in my right hand, while with the other I discovered as accurately as I could by pulsation the exact locality of the heart. It was essential that all the aspects of his death should lead to the surmise of self-murder. I calculated the exact angle at which it was probable that the weapon, if leveled by Simon's own hand, would enter his breast; then with one powerful blow I thrust it up to the hilt in the very spot which I desired to penetrate. A convulsive thrill ran through Simon's limbs. I heard a smothered sound issue from his throat, precisely like the bursting of a large air-bubble, sent up by a diver, when it reaches the surface of the water; he turned half round on his side, and, as if to assist my plans more effectually, his right hand, moved by some mere spasmodic impulse, clasped the handle of the creese, which it remained holding with extraordinary muscular tenacity. Beyond this there was no apparent struggle. [SNIPPET] ""Am I to understand you, Monsieur Simon, that this Mrs. Vulpes replied to questions secretly written by you, which questions related to events known only to yourself?"" ""Ah! more than that, more than that,"" he answered, with an air of some alarm. "" She related to me things——But,"" he added, after a pause, and suddenly changing his manner, ""why occupy ourselves with these follies? It was all the biology, without doubt."
2220,"The Industrialist went on. "" It is for that reason I agreed to see them after I received your letter. Not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade, but to judge their real purposes. I did not count on their evading the meeting."" He sighed. "" [SNIPPET] When he comes in, I'll talk to him."" ""You'd better start. Here he comes."" Red walked into the house and said cheerfully, ""Time for lunch, I guess."" He looked from one parent to the other in quick speculation at their fixed stares and said, ""Got to clean up first, though,"" and made for the other door. The Industrialist said, ""One moment, son."" ""Sir?"""
2221,"This reply fully satisfied the Councillor; the title suited the dress. “ He is certainly,” thought he, “some village schoolmaster—some queer old fellow, such as one still often meets with in Jutland.”  “This is no locus docendi, it is true,” began the clerical gentleman; “yet I beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning. Your reading in the ancients is, sine dubio, of vast extent?”  “Oh yes, I've read something, to be sure,” replied the Councillor. “ I like reading all useful works; but I do not on that account despise the modern ones; 'tis only the unfortunate 'Tales of Every-day Life' that I cannot bear—we have enough and more than enough such in reality.”  “'Tales of Every-day Life?'” [SNIPPET] They ran about with the mirror; and at last there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted in the mirror. So then they thought they would fly up to the sky, and have a joke there. The higher they flew with the mirror, the more terribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast. Higher and higher still they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the mirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands and fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more pieces. And now it worked much more evil than before; for some of these pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in the wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed; and then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye for that which was evil. This happened because the very smallest bit had the same power which the whole mirror had possessed."
2222,"You forget your name, your very existence in this world, and you are taken bodily into a fictitious land. It is[Pg 29] like actually living the books you would read today, or the motion pictures and plays you would watch and hear. ""It is as real as life, but it moves swiftly as a dream. You seem to pass through certain things slowly and completely, in the tempo of life. Then, when the transitional moment comes, between the scenes, your sensations pass with unbelievable rapidity. The Chamber has possession of your mind. [SNIPPET] Then I happened to glance at a mirror for the first time. I stood amazed and transfixed. Overnight I had grown a beard such as wanderers bring back with them from the wilderness. Under the beard, my face seemed to have altered somehow, to have changed in some peculiar way."
2223,"Aren't those trees like those in the coal-measures, Seaton?"" ""True as time, Blackie—there probably won't be a human race here for ages, unless we bring out some colonists."" Seaton kicked at one of the loose lumps of metal questioningly with his heavy shoe, finding that it was as immovable as though it were part of the ledge. Bending over, he found that it required all his great strength to lift it and he stared at it with an expression of surprise, which turned to amazement as he peered closer. [SNIPPET] They stood motionless, locked in each other's arms, while DuQuesne dove through the opening and snapped the door shut behind him. The air-pressure and temperature back to normal, the cumbersome suits were hastily removed, and Seaton's lips met Dorothy's in a long, clinging caress. DuQuesne's cold, incisive voice broke the silence. ""Every second counts."
2224,"Do you no longer remember the sweet fruits, and the cooling juice in the wild plants of our never-to-be-forgotten home?” said the former inhabitant of the Canary Isles, continuing his dithyrambic.  “Oh, yes,” said the Parrot; “but I am far better off here. I am well fed, and get friendly treatment. I know I am a clever fellow; and that is all I care about. Come, let us be men. You are of a poetical nature, as it is called—I, on the contrary, possess profound knowledge and inexhaustible wit. [SNIPPET] Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and legs! It would at least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I know what it is to have a visit from one's old thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I have had a visit from mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end; I was at last about to jump down from the drawers."
2225,"""Not a sound out of you or you get it good and proper. You know what we want. Get to work, Bill; I'll watch his hands.""  ""Help yourselves, boys. I'm not fool enough to scrap about it. Don't hit me or shoot, that's all. [SNIPPET] He was a length or two behind the sailor, praying with all his soul that one or the other might succeed in reaching the white robes that still kept the surface of the water. His crew was ""backing water"" and straining every muscle to bring the boat around sharp for the rescue.  The sailor's powerful strokes brought him to the spot first, but not in time to clutch the disappearing white robes. Just as he reached out an arm to grasp the form of the girl she went down. He did not hesitate a second but followed. Peggy had fallen from the dead Arab's embrace, and that worthy already was at the bottom of the sea. She was half conscious when the shot came, but the plunge into the cold water revived her."
2226,"And it appears that the entrances to the tavern had been somewhere near to the Cross, on the south side of the street; for the crowd fled with great expedition, both to the east and west, and the conquerors, separating themselves as chance directed, pursued impetuously, wounding and maiming as they flew. But it so chanced that, before either of the wings had followed the flying squadrons of their enemies for the space of a hundred yards each way, the devil an enemy they had to pursue! the multitude had vanished like so many thousands of phantoms! What could our heroes do? [SNIPPET] I went and heard him preach for two days, and in fact I held his tenets scarcely short of blasphemy; they were such as I had never heard before, and his congregation, which was numerous, were turning up their ears and drinking in his doctrines with the utmost delight; for Oh they suited their carnal natures and self-sufficiency to a hair! He was actually holding it forth, as a fact, that ""it was every man's own blame if he was not saved!"" What horrible misconstruction! And then he was alleging, and trying to prove from nature and reason, that no man ever was guilty of a sinful action who might not have declined it had he so chosen! "" Wretched controvertist!"""
2227,"But it interested Zaino at least as much. ""Joe! Eileen! There's a column of what looks like black smoke rising over Northeast Spur. It can't be a real fire, of course; I can't see its point of origin, but if it's the convection current it seems to be the source must be pretty hot. [SNIPPET] I don't see how it can possibly be done ... but it's going to be."" ""Come on, Arnie! You're young and strong,"" came the voice of the mineralogist. "" You should be able to lift as much of this stuff as I can. I understand you were lucky enough to get hold of Eileen—have you asked for the bonus yet?—but your work isn't done."" ""It wasn't luck,"" Zaino retorted."
2228,"He didn't like her this way. Explanation was Mecteacher's job and discipline Mecfather's. Mecmother should be warm and loving. Mecteacher appeared and asked Adam to call in the other children so the science lesson could start. He found them tanning in the sunroom, their unclothed bodies evenly browned from invisible light. [SNIPPET] This was such a time now, he felt, as Eve and Mary giggled over to him. They were not nude as had been the custom aboard the ship ever since he turned off the mecs. They had clothes draped over parts of them that seemed somehow to make them more than nude. But they wore red coloring on their lips that he thought was repulsive. He ducked behind the couch, clicked open the familiar combination and descended into the only peace he ever knew."
2229,"In the time it takes Europeans to get ready for one war, we Mamelukes would have fought five wars."" As he spoke he proudly recalled what an Arab poet had written of the Mamelukes: They charge like lightning and arrive like thunder. Manfred turned to watch the riders. A royal privilege, Daoud thought, to conduct an argument at one's chosen pace. He pushed down the urge to say more, forced himself to be patient, waited tensely for Manfred to reply in his own time. He felt a movement beside him and turned to see that Lorenzo had moved closer to him. [SNIPPET] And if I stand here much longer staring they'll notice me and haul me in. He quickly turned his horses away from the gate and headed back to Ugolini's mansion. At the beginning of the third Nocturn, Lorenzo, David, and a servant of Ugolini's named Riccardo, whom they had chosen for his size and strength, emerged from an alley near the north side of the city wall. David wore a hood pulled low over his face. He limped and walked with a stick. Lorenzo had advised against his being out in the street at all, but David had answered that the watch did not know he was in Orvieto and would not be looking for him. Lorenzo was amazed at how rapidly David had gotten better."
2230,"Turning to the consideration of our prose writers, the undersigned finds it difficult to render a true judgment, owing to the adverse conditions mentioned earlier in this report. Many fluent pens are doubtless cramped into feebleness through want of space.  Fiction is among us the least developed of all the branches of literature. Really good stories are rare phenomena, whilst even mediocrity is none too common. The best short stories of the year are probably those by M. Almedia Bretholl and Eleanor Barnhart; the others are mainly juvenile work. [SNIPPET] The co-operative journal is practically the only adequate medium of expression for the amateur of limited means, and most of the later journals of this class, of which the Official Quarterly is itself an example, have been of excellent quality. It is perhaps too much to expect the average President, encumbered with a host of other duties, to conduct this work, but in any event some suitable official should be delegated for that purpose. The association should not lightly abandon a policy which made the preceding administration one of the most brilliant and successful in years.  THE WOODBEE for January exhibits amateur[14] journalism at its best. Mrs. Anne Tillery Renshaw opens the magazine with a pleasing poem, dedicated to the Woodbees, which combines simplicity of diction with regularity of metre. Those decasyllabic quatrains are a decided departure from Mrs. Renshaw's usual style, which explains the slight lack of fluency. The last line of the third stanza contains a redundant syllable, a defect which might be corrected by the removal of the article before the word ""louder"", or by the poetical contraction of ""sympathy"" into ""symp'thy""."
2231,"If they found the specific antibody, or even a general antisperm antibody, that would really get us into trouble for fraud."" He shook his head. "" No. I'm afraid that's not the answer. I don't know what to do."" He poured another drink and downed it. [SNIPPET] It was submitted to me as a possibility from the Dee Lish Company. You needn't worry, however. You are displaying adequate reasons for me to disqualify your entry right now."" ""Oh, an advertising stunt, is it? Harry, this is your idea ... you and that pap purveyor!"" ""But Gloria, think of the publicity ... the big parade with the man from Mars! Why your play would run for years!"""
2232,"There was continual bickering and jangling. Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck. He kept François busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe, fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.  But the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. [SNIPPET] Gad, sir!” stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king of the Skookum Benches. “ I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before the test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.”  Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck’s side.  “You must stand off from him,” Matthewson protested. “"
2233,"I've done my duty to you in more ways than one. I've got myself interviewed by the newspapers and to-day they'll print the whole truth about Montgomery Brewster and his millions. They've got the Sedgwick will and my story and the old town will boil with excitement. I guess you'll be squared before the world, all right. You'd better stay indoors for awhile though, if you want to have a quiet honeymoon.  ""I don't like New York. [SNIPPET] Then,"" he thought exultantly, ""I'll make them feel this a bit.""  He longed for the time when he could take his few friends with him and sail away to the Mediterranean to escape the eyes and tongues of New York. Impatiently he urged Harrison to complete the arrangements, so that they could start at once. But Harrison's face was not untroubled when he made his report. All the preliminary details had been perfected. He had taken the ""Flitter"" for four months, and it was being overhauled and put into condition for the voyage. It had been Brown's special pride, but at his death it went to heirs who were ready and eager to rent it to the highest bidder."
2234,"Three famous jumpers were they, as everyone would say, when they all met together in the room.  “I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest,” exclaimed the King; “for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for.”  The Flea was the first to step forward. He had exquisite manners, and bowed to the company on all sides; for he had noble blood, and was, moreover, accustomed to the society of man alone; and that makes a great difference.  Then came the Grasshopper. [SNIPPET] Little Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer. The cold was so intense that she could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of her mouth. It grew thicker and thicker, and took the form of little angels, that grew more and more when they touched the earth. All had helms on their heads, and lances and shields in their hands; they increased in numbers; and when Gerda had finished the Lord's Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole legion. They thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that they flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and in security. The angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the cold less, and went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen."
2235,"Then turn the switch and get out."" I come back and see by my chrono that the blood-seal should be set; I get my hands under the computer. M'Clare bangs his hand on the floor. ""Lizzie, you little idiot, don't you realize that even if you get me out of this ship, which is next to impossible, you'll be delayed all the way—and if the Incognitans find either of us the whole plan's ruined? Much worse than ruined, once they see it's a hoax—"" I tell him I have two Andite sticks and they won't find us and on a night like this any story of explosions will be put down to sudden gusts or to lightning. He is silent for a moment while I start lifting the computer, carefully; its effective weight with the antigrav full on is only about twenty pounds but is has all its inertia. [SNIPPET] I know people had wars, I know one reason we do not have them now is just that with so many planets and cheap transportation, pressure has other outlets; these people scrapped their ships for factories and never built more. But. There are only about ten million of them and surely to goodness a whole planet gives room enough to keep out of each other's hair? Well this is not Reasoning but a Reaction, I go back to the data for another look. The root trouble is stated to be that two groups landed on the planet without knowing the others were there, when they met thirty years later they got a disagreeable shock."
2236,"Her waking, which gave me a pang at first, afforded me in the end a still greater bliss.  ""Oh, how dark it is—where am I?"" she exclaimed, starting suddenly from repose.  ""With me, sweetest,"" I said. "" Do you not remember going to sleep on my breast?""  ""Yes; but oh, why did you not wake me sooner? [SNIPPET] Finding that I could not read the words, I hazarded the remark that it was Yoletta's mother, perhaps.  ""This portrait was painted four centuries ago,"" he said, with surprise in his accent; and then he turned aside, thinking me, perhaps, a rather dull and ignorant person.  I did not want him to go away with that impression, and remarked, pointing to the statue I have spoken of: ""I fancy I know very well who that is—that is Europa.""  ""Europa? That is a name I never heard; I doubt that any one in the house ever bore it."" Then, with a half-puzzled smile, he added: ""How could you possibly know unless you were told? No, that is Mistrelde."
2237,"The engines were at work, and we were saved!     We owed our salvation to Mr. Carmichael. [SNIPPET] ""I am going to do a thing that I have never done in my life before,"" said Mr. Carmichael, in a sad and doubtful tone; ""I have kept this secret so long that it seems like parting with myself to disclose it, to disclose even the existence of it. I have fed upon it as a young man feeds on love. It has been my nourishment, my manna in the wilderness of this world, my solace under a thousand trials, my inspiration from on High. I verily believe it has kept my old carcase together."
2238,"Vyrko went to that corner and drew back a curtain. There was a chair of metal rods, and a crude control panel, though it was hard to see what it was intended to control. He dropped the curtain. For a moment he stood watching Lavra. She was a fool, but she was exceedingly lovely. And the child of Kirth-Labbery could hardly carry only a fool's genes. Several generations could grow up in this retreat before the inevitable failure of the most permanent mechanical installations made it uninhabitable. [SNIPPET] No,"" she said in sudden surprise. "" No,"" and her voice fell to flatness, ""you haven't...."" And as her sobs—the first he had ever heard from her—traveled away toward the hydroponic room, he felt a new and not readily understood emotion. He switched off the film wire midway through the pyrotechnic rage of the eighteenth-century queen of darkness."
2239,"It is difficult to make conversation with a man. Finally Juba gave up trying to think of something interesting to say and asked, ""What is your way of life, that you should be going around by yourself in a space ship?"" ""My way of life?"" He laughed. "" It becomes a way of life, doesn't it? Whatever we do ends up enveloping us, doesn't it?"" [SNIPPET] Then we can planet in blind, if necessary, to set up our station."" ""But as soon as you take off,"" Juba said, wondering if she would really do such a thing or if she would suddenly wake as from a dream and find her wits again, ""they'll be on me with their questions. And what could I say to them?"" ""You won't have to say anything to them,"" the Man said. """
2240,"All I knew for sure was that, as the poem stood, it sounded as if somebody had loused up a perfect Grilch Hop rhyme. And Uncle Izzy knew I was a Grilch Hop expert in Middle School and this was the only real Grilch Hop rhythm in the book. What's more, Uncle Izzy could depend on me to go over that book in painstaking detail because a studs and neck clasp man has to be good on details. ""All right,"" I said. "" You look your way and I'll look my way."" ""We're not looking any more any way today,"" Rene said, emerging from Uncle Isadore's ship loaded down with removings. "" [SNIPPET] ""I have no idea. He might have all his money piled in the locker of the Whist Club of Sirius beta. In that case, we look for a key. Or he might have a block of Eretrevium buried somewhere. Your guess is as good as mine."" ""If he's dug up the ground,"" Rene said, ""I'll recognize the spot."
2241,"Come on, let's go up to the loft."" They clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them. Slim pointed and said, ""There's sort of a hole in the canvas."" Red frowned. "" How'd that get there?"" He lifted the canvas, looked in, and said, with relief, ""They're still there."" [SNIPPET] ""Sure—in the city. Out here we grind our own and it's always this color till it's cooked."" ""You mean it isn't cooked?"" Slim drew away quickly."
2242,"The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of [115]plants through man's agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country. It might, also, perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes. But the case is very different; and Alph. [SNIPPET] There is one other point which seems to me worth notice. Varieties generally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely more than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of its supposed parent-species, their denominations ought to be reversed. But there is also reason to believe, that those species which are very closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have much restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H. C. Watson has marked for me in the well-sifted London Catalogue of plants (4th edition) 63 plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these 63 reputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this same catalogue, 53 acknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces; whereas, the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3 provinces. So that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range, as have those very closely allied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally ranked by British botanists as good and true species."
2243,"Yeah, but you’ve got a different kind of a missing link.” “Vertical-slit pupils in their eyes,” said Orne. He studied the figure. It had been caught from the front by a mini-sneaker camera. About five feet tall. [SNIPPET] We want this planet cleared for contact or dead before then.” “I don’t like this, Stet.” “YOU don’t like it!” “Look,” said Orne. “"
2244,"On the fifth night the rats came by the thousands. They appeared to be hunting for something, but in the meantime, they ate and soiled whatever came their way. The local cats fought heroically, but were soon killed and eaten. The rats came up from the cellar through the elevator shafts, up the steps, through the cracks in the floor, up and up till they started to run around the roof. Then, at four in the morning, they started to leave, running down the steps in close formation, seemingly panic-stricken at their own temerity and anxious only to return to their safe, dark haunts. [SNIPPET] ""Simple enough. I am a hundred per cent American. For five generations my people have been born and buried in this city. I own over two hundred million dollars worth of land here. When the dregs of Europe come over to my city and use the rats of Asia to bleed that city white, then I personally protest. I am going to start something. I am not sure what, but when I finish, this city will be practically rat empty and gangster free."""
2245,"Un bijou!”  And he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him. Their host smiled approvingly.  “No, I am not going to stay,” answered Anna, smiling, but in spite of her smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay. [SNIPPET] But Varenka did not even know what Kitty’s eyes were asking her. She merely thought that she had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to make haste home in time for maman’s tea at twelve o’clock. She went indoors, collected her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.  “Allow me to see you home,” said the colonel."
2246,"His mind was undergoing a subtle change. It took moments for it to cast off its battleful ways and resume its accustomed course of thought. Gradually his brain emerged from the clogged clouds, and at last he was enabled to more closely comprehend himself and circumstance.  He understood then that the existence of shot and countershot was in the past. He had dwelt in a land of strange, squalling upheavals and had come forth. He had been where there was red of blood and black of passion, and he was escaped. [SNIPPET] But the long serpents crawled slowly from hill to hill without bluster of smoke. A dun-colored cloud of dust floated away to the right. The sky overhead was of a fairy blue.  The youth studied the faces of his companions, ever on the watch to detect kindred emotions."
2247,"The monstrous associate of Hekalu and the flitting specks of light far beyond Mars seemed to bear out the nobleman's boast. And if he somehow got possession of the Atomic Ray! And Jan—What was he going to do to Jan! Certainly it was she to whom he had referred! It was this last idea which hammered on Shelby's brain hardest of all. A little fiend within him seemed to shriek. "" [SNIPPET] Briefly Shelby outlined the events of the past few days, starting with his meeting with Hekalu. However, he was careful not to make any mention of the Atomic Ray. Then, partially through curiosity, and partially in the hope that the information might be helpful, he mentally asked his companion to tell him more about the Space Men's relations with the Martian. ""Everything maybe all right,"" said the giant. """
2248,"My name, perchance, wouldst have me mention? The witch. Pardon the rudeness, sir, in me! But sure no cloven foot I see. Nor find I your two ravens either. Mephistopheles. [SNIPPET] Christ has arisen Out of corruption's gloom. Break from your prison, Burst every tomb! Livingly owning him, Lovingly throning him, Feasting fraternally, Praying diurnally, Bearing his messages, Sharing his promises, Find ye your master near, Find ye him here![10]  Pedestrians of all descriptions stroll forth."
2249,"They were not dreams of the men he had killed in battle, or, except for one about a huge, hot-smelling tank with a red star on the turret, about the war. Generally, they were about a strange, beautiful, office-room, in which a young man in uniform killed an older man in a plum-brown coat and a vivid blue neck-scarf. Sometimes Benson identified himself with the killer; sometimes with the old man who was killed. He talked to Myers about these dreams, but beyond generalities about delayed effects of combat fatigue and vague advice to relax, the psychologist, now head of Sales & Promotion of Evri-Flave, Inc., could give him no help. The war ended three years after the new company was launched. There was a momentary faltering of the economy, and then the work of reconstruction was crying hungrily for all the labor and capital that had been idled by the end of destruction, and more. There was a new flood-tide of prosperity, and Evri-Flave rode the crest. [SNIPPET] I have no moral or psychological taboos against killing dictators, or anybody else. Suppose I cooperate with you; what's in it for me?"" There was a long silence. Walter and Carl looked at one another inquiringly; the others dithered helplessly. It was Carl who answered. ""Your return to your own time and place."" ""And if I don't cooperate with you?"""
2250,"""You're sufficiently conceited,"" she replied. "" Laura, come here; your brother is teasing me."" ""And do you think I want to be teased to?"" replied that young lady, pertly, as she walked off. [SNIPPET] ""Really,"" she replied, airily, ""you take too much for granted. I was going to ask Tom Longman to take me out."" She called to Tom, and as he came up, grinning and shambling, she indicated to him her pleasure that he should row her upon the river. The idea of being alone in a small boat for perhaps fifteen minutes with the belle of Newville, and the object of his own secret and distant adoration, paralysed Tom's faculties with an agony of embarrassment. He grew very red, and there was such a buzzing in his ears that he could not feel sure he heard aright, and Madeline had to repeat herself several times before he seemed to fully realize the appalling nature of the proposition."
2251,"He said No, he could not do that, for then he could not have the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, at the ship’s return. Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and treacherous people; likewise those of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, cruel, and treacherous than they. But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion; the first thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan. While I was doing this, the young man whom my nephew had left with me as my companion came up, and told me that he thought that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or as I pleased to order him; that if ever he came to England, and I was there and alive, he would render me a faithful account of his success, which should be as much mine as I pleased. I was loath to part with him; but considering the prospect of advantage, which really was considerable, and that he was a young fellow likely to do well in it, I inclined to let him go; but I told him I would consult my partner, and give him an answer the next day. I discoursed about it with my partner, who thereupon made a most generous offer: “You know it has been an unlucky ship,” said he, “and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again; if your steward” (so he called my man) “will venture the voyage, I will leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship’s freight to us; the other shall be his own.” If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man, made him such an offer, I could not do less than offer him the same; and all the ship’s company being willing to go with him, we made over half the ship to him in property, and took a writing from him, obliging him to account for the other, and away he went to Japan. [SNIPPET] Now, to go any one of these journeys in the winter would have been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been frozen up and I could not get passage; and to go by land in those countries was far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise, as to Archangel in October, all the ships would be gone from thence, and even the merchants who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone; so that I could have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie in an empty town all the winter. Therefore, upon the whole, I thought it much my better way to let the caravan go, and make provision to winter where I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of provisions, such as the country afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent company. I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved island, where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back, and never made any fire but without doors, which was necessary for dressing my food, &c. Now I had three good vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet, and button close to the wrists; and all these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently warm."
2252,"""Hell, yes. How do we get out, after we done pinned Santa Anna down? You thought of that, Billy boy?"" Travis shrugged. "" There is an element of grave risk, of course. Ord, where's the document, the message you wrote up for me? Ah, thank you."" [SNIPPET] Travis' eye gleamed. "" Think of it, boys! He'll have to mount a frontal attack, against protected American riflemen. Ord, couldn't your Englishers tell him a few things about that!"" ""Whoa, now,"" Jim barked. "" Billy, anybody tell you there's maybe four or five thousand Mexicaners comin'?"""
2253,"You should see her!"" I was interested in his problem, so I went. Helen greeted me at the door and I had the surprise of my life. At one time, she had been beautiful, but she had faded during the past few years. By staying indoors, she had grown pale, listless. [SNIPPET] He still wanted Helen but she had changed into a personality that he hated. Over a period of years, she had changed into a morbid hypochondriac, an unpleasant woman who enjoyed—more than anything else—such things as having one of her legs replaced and sampling the latest pills and drugs. George said he had tried to get her to see a psychiatrist but she refused. And you can't have a person committed to a mental institution because they have an unpleasant personality! It seemed as if there was no solution to his problem."
2254,"Vyrko, naturally, had no idea of the origin of the yellow bands. Even Kirth-Labbery could offer no more than conjectures. From another planet, another system, another galaxy, another universe. It did not matter. [SNIPPET] ""The day before Father ... died, I was in here with him and I asked if there was any hope of our escaping ever. Only this time he answered me. He said yes, there was a way out, but he was afraid of it. It was an idea he'd worked on but never tried. And we'd be wiser not to try it, he said."" ""I don't believe in arguing with your father—even post mortem."" ""But I can't help wondering.... And when he said it, he looked over at that corner."""
2255,"I hope Lady Blakeney is well,” said Chauvelin, hurriedly changing the topic of conversation.  Blakeney, with much deliberation, finished his plate of soup, drank his glass of wine, and, momentarily, it seemed to Marguerite as if he glanced quickly all round the room.  “Quite well, thank you,” he said at last, drily. There was a pause, during which Marguerite could watch these two antagonists who, evidently in their minds, were measuring themselves against one another. She could see Percy almost full face where he sat at the table not ten yards from where she herself was crouching, puzzled, not knowing what to do, or what she should think. She had quite controlled her impulse by now of rushing down and disclosing herself to her husband. [SNIPPET] How that stupid, dull Englishman ever came to be admitted within the intellectual circle which revolved round “the cleverest woman in Europe,” as her friends unanimously called her, no one ventured to guess—a golden key is said to open every door, asserted the more malignantly inclined.  Enough, she married him, and “the cleverest woman in Europe” had linked her fate to that “demmed idiot” Blakeney, and not even her most intimate friends could assign to this strange step any other motive than that of supreme eccentricity. Those friends who knew, laughed to scorn the idea that Marguerite St. Just had married a fool for the sake of the worldly advantages with which he might endow her. They knew, as a matter of fact, that Marguerite St. Just cared nothing about money, and still less about a title; moreover, there were at least half a dozen other men in the cosmopolitan world equally well-born, if not so wealthy as Blakeney, who would have been only too happy to give Marguerite St. Just any position she might choose to covet.  As for Sir Percy himself, he was universally voted to be totally unqualified for the onerous post he had taken upon himself. His chief qualifications for it seemed to consist in his blind adoration for her, his great wealth, and the high favour in which he stood at the English court; but London society thought that, taking into consideration his own intellectual limitations, it would have been wiser on his part had he bestowed those worldly advantages upon a less brilliant and witty wife.  Although lately he had been so prominent a figure in fashionable English society, he had spent most of his early life abroad."
2256,"Bobby said, ""Because that's what you do with experiments, stupid."" ""But, Bob, it smells like garbage."" ""Medicine smells worse and it makes you healthy,"" Bob said, while stirring the pot with an old wooden spoon. Bonnie held her nose, stood on tiptoe and looked in at the cooking solution. "" Will this make us healthy?"" ""Maybe."" Bob kept stirring. [SNIPPET] ""Okay, ten cents."" She counted out the money to her brother and put on an apron. "" What should I do now, Bob?"" ""Get the salt,"" Bob instructed. He poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful not to let the sardines fall in."
2257,"Never was such a Januarius, though there's no snow. Snow will not come, or tears. Yet my brain burns with the thought of Mary's death-warrant unsigned. There's my particular hell!—to doom, perchance, all future queens, or leave a hole for the Spaniard and the Pope to creep like old worms back into the sweet apple of England. Philip's tall black crooked ships massing like sea-going fortresses south-away—cragged castles set to march into the waves. Parma in the Lowlands! [SNIPPET] He looked so downright goofy that it took my mind off Nefer-in-character for all of eight seconds. His levied bottom half still looked like The Lower Depths. Martin is Village Stanislavsky rather than Ye Olde English Stage Traditions. But above that ... well, all it really amounted to was that he was stripped to the waist and had shaved off the small high tuft of chest hair and was wearing a black wig that hung down in front of his shoulders in two big braids heavy with silver hoops and pins. But just the same those simple things, along with his tarpaper-solarium tan and habitual poker expression, made him look so like an American Indian that I thought, Hey Zeus!—he's all set to play Hiawatha, or if he'd just cover up that straight-line chest, a frowny Pocahontas. And I quick ran through what plays with Indian parts we do and could only come up with The Fountain."
2258,"I had not experienced the least nervousness on the occasion of my first visit the night before, yet the mere sight of this package on my desk, with its note of explanation, now caused me an uneasiness, which, try as I would, I could not ignore. Making the few necessary preparations about my room for the night, I secured the door with lock and bolt, and, drawing my couch before the instrument, poured out a glass of wine and lit a cigar, hoping thus to steady my nerves. The day had been warm and close, and a thunderstorm of unusual violence made the night a wild one. Vivid flashes of lightning that seemed to vie with each other in intensity, darted from the heavens, accompanied by deafening crashes of thunder that shook the building to its foundations, while the shrieking of the wind, as though it were rushing through the rigging of a ship at sea, added to the noise of the tempest. Within a few moments the glow on my instrument would be the signal for my departure, and, as I prepared the cone of chloroform, I could not suppress a shudder at the thought of my spirit going out into the fury of such a storm. It seemed as if Death, in the fear of being driven from Earth and forever despoiled of his cruel victories, had turned loose the elements in his fury, and waited without to wreak vengeance on my audacious spirit as it sped through space. An instant an intensely white glare on the surface of wires at this moment gave evidence of the super-radium current. [SNIPPET] That the shadow on the film had been that of a Martian, I dared not hope. Though my mind continually reverted to this wild conjecture, I impatiently put it aside, as the apparent impossibility of it all would force itself upon me. Nothing further could be done that night, and as I had worked hard all day preparing for my experiment, without even stopping for meals, I now felt the effect of the excitement I had undergone and resolved to take a walk in the cool air, I wanted to think, and, if possible, to plan a line of action for the morrow which would bring me better results, if my theory of light-waves should prove to be correct. Needless to say, I determined to cease my former experiments, and devote all my energy to ascertaining whether my apparatus was actually responding to Martian light-waves of remarkable integrity, and if such proved to be the case, to put every effort into improving the device with the hope of obtaining their import. I also determined to keep my discovery a secret, at least for the present."
2259,"That's got to go. Don't ask us to sell that to the troops!"" Travis closed his eyes briefly. "" Boys, listen. We don't have to tell the men about this. They don't need to know the real story until it's too late for them to get out. And then we shall cover ourselves with such glory that none of us shall ever be forgotten. [SNIPPET] ""Well, that's that,"" Jim said unhappily. "" So what you figurin' to do, Bill?"" Travis stood up in the weak, flickering candlelight, one hand on the polished hilt of his saber. The other two men winced, watching him. """
2260,"he asked. ""About that Martian ship,"" she repeated. "" It just landed on the old spaceport. You can see it from the window."" ""For God's sake!"" [SNIPPET] An Afro-Asian with skin like dark honey and smooth, pleasant, rather flat features. It was, he thought, a pity she had that third eye in her forehead. She stood beside him while he ran through the letters and signed them. "" Meeting of the regional vice-chancellors tomorrow, eh?"" he said as he handed them back to her. ""Right, chancellor,"" she said crisply. "" Ten o'clock."
2261,"To be doing something I started to inspect the instrument panel and right away I was all excited again. The two screens were what got me. They showed shadowy maps, one of North America, the other of the World. The first one was a whole lot like the map I'd been imagining earlier—faint colors marked the small ""civilized"" areas including one in Eastern Canada and another in Upper Michigan that must be ""countries"" I didn't know about, and the Deathlands were real dark just as I'd always maintained they should be! South of Lake Michigan was a brightly luminous green point that must be where we were, I decided. [SNIPPET] We were almost close enough now and he was steeling himself to shoot and I remember wondering for a split second what his damn gun did to you, and then me and the girl had started the alternation routine. I'd stop dead, as if completely cowed by the threat of his weapon, and as he took note of it she'd go in a little further, and as his gaze shifted to her she'd stop dead and I'd go in another foot and then try to make my halt even more convincing as his gaze darted back to me. We worked it perfectly, our rhythm was beautiful, as if we were old dancing partners, though the whole thing was absolutely impromptu. Still, I honestly don't think we'd ever have got to him if it hadn't been for the distraction that came just then to help us. I could tell, you see, that he'd finally steeled himself and we still weren't quite close enough."
2262,"If you have no interest in our theories there is little need to pursue our plans further, where you are concerned."" ""We are interested, of course,"" said Jeter. "" We are interested in your theories, without committing ourselves to acceptance of them; and we are naturally interested in saving our lives. Let us say then, for the moment, that we do not refuse to join you."" ""You will have twenty-four hours in which to decide whether to join us,"" was Sitsumi's ultimatum. "" We would not allow you five minutes were it not that our cause would be benefited by the addition of your scientific knowledge."" Sitsumi did not repeat the alternative. [SNIPPET] ""What's the next move? ""We'll systematically cover the sky over an area which blankets New York, Long Island, Jersey City and surrounding territory for a distance of twenty miles. If we're above the enemy, perhaps we can look down upon him. We know he can't be seen from below, perhaps not even from above. If we are below him we'll try to fly into that column of his."
2263,"Let 'em come, Pop,"" he said cheerfully. "" Hope they do. We'll shoot 'em all. Won't we, pop? You got the rifle and the pistol ready, Pop...."" Yes, John Endlich had his guns ready beside him, all right—for what it was worth. He wished wryly that things could be as simple as his hero-worshipping son seemed to think. [SNIPPET] All at once, conforming to the changeable weather of children's natures regardless of circumstance, their mood had once more turned bright and adventurous. ""Look, Pop,"" Bubs chirped, his round red face beaming now from his helmet face-window, in spite of his undried tears. "" This land all around here was fields once! You can even see the rows of some kind of stubble!"
2264,"""How do they get away from it?"" he asked. ""Well, I don't know quite,"" she said. "" I'm a sap about stuff like that. All I know is what the guy that was controlling me thought about and let me have without knowing it. [SNIPPET] She glanced out of the window. Not there. The sound again—not from outdoors, but behind her—within the room? She gripped the gun Vanderschoof had given her. Rattle, rattle. She wished furiously for a light."
2265,"The other two men winced, watching him. "" Gentlemen, Houston's trying to pull his militia together while he falls back. You know, Texas was woefully unprepared for a contest at arms. The general's idea is to draw Santa Anna as far into Texas as he can, then hit him when he's extended, at the right place, and right time. [SNIPPET] Then he lit it, saying around it, ""All right, let's all calm down. Nothing a group of good men can't settle around a table. Now listen. I got in with this revolution at first because I thought old Emperor Iturbide would listen to reason and lower taxes."
2266,"4. The Eye of M There was a light in Simon's room as I entered my house. A vague impulse urged me to visit him. As I opened the door of his sitting-room unannounced, he was bending, with his back toward me, over a carcel lamp, apparently engaged in minutely examining some object which he held in his hands. As I entered, he started suddenly, thrust his hand into his breast pocket, and turned to me with a face crimson with confusion. [SNIPPET] I can not, I dare not, attempt to inventory the charms of this divine revelation of perfect beauty. Those eyes of mystic violet, dewy and serene, evade my words. Her long, lustrous hair following her glorious head in a golden wake, like the track sown in heaven by a falling star, seems to quench my most burning phrases with its splendors. If all the bees of Hybla nestled upon my lips, they would still sing but hoarsely the wondrous harmonies of outline that enclosed her form. She swept out from between the rainbow-curtains of the cloud-trees into the broad sea of light that lay beyond."
2267,"Then it, too, went under. A great roll of water marked the spot. The plumed hat floated.  There was a confusion of shouts from the raft, of screams from the roof. [SNIPPET] Yet you, with a woman’s instinct, will have already caught the clue to it. It needs no mirror to assure me that the clue is here for you, in my eyes. It needs no dictionary of quotations to remind me that the eyes are the windows of the soul. And I know that from two open windows my soul has been leaning and signalling to you, in a code far more definitive and swifter than words of mine, that I love you.”  Zuleika, listening to him, had grown gradually paler and paler. She had raised her hands and cowered as though he were about to strike her."
2268,"One of the barren women must have adopted him and brought him up as her own. So Len Mattern filled out all the papers and was inscribed on the ship's rolls. And he made the terrible jump through hyperspace for the first time. People who traveled on spaceships only as passengers never could understand why the Jump was invariably referred to as ""terrible."" That was because before the ship made the Jump they'd be given drugs, in their cocktails, in their food at dinner, or in their drinking water—and the next day they'd wake up and find they had slept right through the whole thing, so it couldn't be so awful. [SNIPPET] The flickering terror of their appearance became more awesome to him than it had been at the beginning, when he'd been only a transitory shadow in hyperspace. Now, although he had no doubt that they were friendly—indeed, almost ardent in their welcoming—horror chilled him all over again. He could almost feel the molecules inside his body slow down as his viscera quivered faintly and then froze into stillness. He looked at Schiemann and Balas. Neither of them could, he knew, see the hyperspacers. Their conditioning back on Earth's space schools had ensured this. That was the real reason for the schools; any actual training was incidental."
2269,"It must have been almost ground-zero of one of the hydrogen-bombs; the wreckage of the Cathedral of Learning had fallen predominantly to the north, and the Carnegie Library was tumbled to the east. ""I think the entrance would be on this side, toward the Library,"" Altamont said. "" Let's try it, to begin with."" He used the solenoid-hammer, slowly pounding a hole into the glaze, and placed a small charge of the plastic explosive. [SNIPPET] At least, when they sprang to their feet and started to run at the return of the helicopter, many did not run far. Altamont and Loudons shook hands many times in front of the Aitch-Cue House, and listened to many good wishes, and repeated their promise to return. Most of the microfilmed books were still stored in the old church; they were taking away with them only the catalogue and a few of the more important works. Finally, they entered the helicopter. The crowd shouted farewell, as they rose. Altamont, at the controls, waited until they had gained five thousand feet, then turned on a compass-course for Colony Three."
2270,"Across the smoke-infested fields came a brown swarm of running men who were giving shrill yells. They came on, stooping and swinging their rifles at all angles. A flag, tilted forward, sped near the front.  As he caught sight of them the youth was momentarily startled by a thought that perhaps his gun was not loaded. He stood trying to rally his faltering intellect so that he might recollect the moment when he had loaded, but he could not.  A hatless general pulled his dripping horse to a stand near the colonel of the 304th. [SNIPPET] In death it exposed to his enemies that poverty which in life he had perhaps concealed from his friends.  The ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse. The invulnerable dead man forced a way for himself. The youth looked keenly at the ashen face."
2271,"In this way, wholly apart from the moral aspects of the matter, the progress of chemical, sanitary, and mechanical science owes an incalculable debt to the Revolution."" ""Probably,"" I said, ""you have sometimes eccentric persons--'crooked sticks' we used to call them--who refuse to adapt themselves to the social order on any terms or admit any such thing as social duty. If such a person should flatly refuse to render any sort of industrial or useful service on any terms, what would be done with him? No doubt there is a compulsory side to your system for dealing with such persons?"" ""Not at all,"" replied the doctor. "" If our system can not stand on its merits as the best possible arrangement for promoting the highest welfare of all, let it fall. As to the matter of industrial service, the law is simply that if any one shall refuse to do his or her part toward the maintenance of the social order he shall not be allowed to partake of its benefits. [SNIPPET] Tell me, were the families of the well-to-do and cultured class in the America of your day, as a whole, large?"" ""Quite the contrary. They did not, as a rule, more than replace themselves."" ""Still, they were not prevented by any motive of prudence from increasing their numbers. They occupied in this respect as independent a position as families do under the present order of economic equality and guaranteed maintenance. Did it never occur to you why the families of the well-to-do and cultured in your day were not larger?"""
2272,"""Never.""  ""Well,"" said the Nome, ""I knew all the Oz people, and you can guess I do not love them. All during my wanderings I have brooded on how I can be revenged on them. Now that I've met you I can see a way to conquer the Land of Oz and be King there myself, which is better than being King of the Nomes.""  ""How can you do that?"" inquired Kiki Aru, wonderingly.  ""Never mind how. [SNIPPET] I just walked across the river on the bottom.""  ""Under the water?"" exclaimed Trot.  The cat gave her a scornful look.  ""How could I walk OVER the water on the BOTTOM of the river? If you were transparent, anyone could see YOUR brains were not working."
2273,"“Yes, I see that if Miles took it instead he probably will have read it and destroyed it.”  “And don’t you see anything else?”  I faced her a moment with a sad smile. “ It strikes me that by this time your eyes are open even wider than mine.”  They proved to be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show it. “ I make out now what he must have done at school.” [SNIPPET] Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been. That came out—she couldn’t tell her story without its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither of us spoke of it. I remember the time and the place—the corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summer afternoon. It wasn’t a scene for a shudder; but oh—!” He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair."
2274,"Whatever the true explanation may be, the fact remains that the operation can be done, that it actually prolongs life indefinitely, and that I alone know the secret."" Sir John told me a very great deal more, but, after all, I think it amounted to little more than this. It would be impossible for me to express the great hold his discovery took upon my mind the moment he recounted it. From the very first, under the spell of his personality, I believed, and I knew he was speaking the truth. And it opened up before me new vistas. I began to see myself become suddenly eternal, never again to know the fear of death. I could see myself storing up, century after century, an amplitude of wisdom and experience that would make me truly a god. [SNIPPET] I had no consciousness of monotony, for, to the intellect, monotony cannot exist: it was one of those emotions I had left behind. One day, however, in the year 2132, a great discovery was made by a man called Zarentzov. It had to do with the curvature of space, quite changing the conceptions that we had all followed since Einstein. I had long ago mastered the last detail of Einstein's theory, as had, in time, the rest of the world."
2275,"""Scottie, you should take more pride in your office!"" snapped Polly. "" You're an important man."" ""If it weren't for you, I'd be a nobody and prefer it,"" said Bullone. [SNIPPET] Abruptly, Stetson hurled the service record at the gray metal wall across from him; then he got up, brought the record back to his desk, smoothing the pages. There were tears in his eyes. He flipped a switch on his desk, dictated the notification to Central Secretarial, ordered it sent out priority. Then he went groundside and got drunk on Hochar Brandy, Orne's favorite drink. The next morning there was a reply from Chargon: ""Lewis Orne's mother too ill to travel. Sisters being notified. Please ask Mrs. Ipscott Bullone of Marak, wife of the High Commissioner, to take over for family."""
2276,"Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door that had imprisoned us. ""Miller!"" ""Yes?"" ""See if you can get this thing open from the outside."" [SNIPPET] Who knows? But see how it curves? If it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!"" ""If it's a perfect sphere,"" Miller suggested, ""most of it must be beneath the Moon's surface."""
2277,"In one end of the ship, a miniature farm was born hydroponically, its automatic grinders pre-digesting ripe vegetables for the children. Animals were born, too, for food, but also companionship, and later to stock New Earth ahead. As the babies began to understand, the woman voices merged into one mechanical mother who could be heard and seen and summoned on panel screens throughout the ship. Everything became as Earthlike as possible, but because the environment was artificial, the children grew aware of their purpose in life at an age rarely reached on ancient Earth. They were two years old when their Mecmother informed them: ""You are unlike any children ever born. [SNIPPET] During Joseph's delay, the girls ambled off somewhere and returned only when Adam shouted after them in exasperation. Quickening his pace, Adam reached the classroom first and asked Mecteacher, ""Are the other children—deep?"" ""Deep? Yes, Adam, Mecfather explained that to you."
2278,"“The time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history, in any way.”  “Oh, the little lady doesn’t remember. She never heard or knew.”  “The circumstances of his death?” I thought with some intensity. “ Perhaps not. [SNIPPET] “Well, he didn’t like tale-bearing—he hated complaints. He was terribly short with anything of that kind, and if people were all right to him—”  “He wouldn’t be bothered with more?” This squared well enough with my impressions of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very particular perhaps about some of the company he kept. All the same, I pressed my interlocutress. “ I promise you I would have told!”"
2279,"At length, I grew so pale and emaciated, from want of rest and continual brooding over my insane love and its cruel conditions, that I determined to make some effort to wean myself from it. "" Come,"" I said, ""this is at best but a fantasy. Your imagination has bestowed on Animula charms which in reality she does not possess. Seclusion from female society has produced this morbid condition of mind. Compare her with the beautiful women of your own world, and this false enchantment will vanish."" [SNIPPET] I also emptied some more laudanum into Simon's glass—having first removed from it all traces of wine—cleaned the other wine-glass, and brought the bottles away with me. If traces of two persons drinking had been found in the room, the question naturally would have arisen, Who was the second? Besides, the wine-bottles might have been identified as belonging to me. The laudanum I poured out to account for its presence in his stomach, in case of a post-mortem examination. The theory naturally would be, that he first intended to poison himself, but, after swallowing a little of the drug, was either disgusted with its taste, or changed his mind from other motives, and chose the dagger. These arrangements made, I walked out, leaving the gas burning, locked the door with my vise, and went to bed. Simon's death was not discovered until nearly 3 in the afternoon."
2280,"In reality society is infinitely complex, and the ramifications and possibilities are endless. It can do a lot more things than fizzle or go boom. Pressure of population, war or persecution patterns can cause waves of immigration. Plant and animal species can be wiped out by momentary needs or fashions. Remember the fate of the passenger pigeon and the American bison. [SNIPPET] I want you to run a new basic survey, ignoring the old one still in operation, to re-examine the check points on our graphs. The trouble may lie there."" Neel thought before he answered, picking his words carefully. "" Wouldn't that be a little ... unethical, sir? After all Hengly, who is operator there now, is a friend of mine."
2281,"He coughed and went down in the sand. The gun winked again, spitting its bright eye of light at the girl. She went down like a falling doll. McLean pulled himself up on one knee and one hand. There was a hole in his chest as big as his fist, but there was no pain. [SNIPPET] That was the way I picked him out."" ""Do some more differentiating between colors,"" he invited, waving her back to the sight of the Rangeley. "" Maybe, by Harry, we'll get out of here alive after all!"" Hope surged in his voice. """
2282,"I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life, for instance to fly through the air; but that when this had been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and widely throughout the world. I will now give a few examples to illustrate these [304]remarks, and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced. I may recall the well-known fact that in geological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals, for its thickness, belongs to the middle of the secondary series; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series. [SNIPPET] The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated by seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced, has even been advanced—for it is now as tender as ever it was—as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! The case, also, of the kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling kidney-beans ever appear, for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than others. On the whole, I think we may conclude that habit, [143]use, and disuse, have, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by the natural selection of innate variations.   Correlation of Growth.—I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied together during its growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified."
2283,"And back came the tremendous news: “Results! Man, the world’s crazy! They’re gone—everywhere! Tell the professor to lay off, before he sends us scooting too.” “Right!” said Jim, cutting his motor. “ [SNIPPET] “Before I answer that question,” Professor Wentworth replied, “I shall let you witness a little demonstration.” He advanced to the cannon-like device at the other end of the room, swung it on its swivel till it was pointing directly at that fluorescent orange tube on the table. “Watch closely!” he said, throwing a switch. There was a sudden, whining hum in the air and the nib of the big tube glowed a soft, velvety green. Jim gazed at the scene with rapt attention."
2284,"“No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears.  “Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted.  Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail. [SNIPPET] “We’ll try to,” replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing his hand.  At that moment the door opened.  “Here he is at last!” shouted Rostóv. “ And Berg too!"
2285,"Radio's out. But this is a thousand times better."" He extended the sheet to Ben, who examined the maze of figures gravely for a moment. ""Now suppose you interpret,"" he said. "" [SNIPPET] It couldn't have happened overnight."" ""Why not?"" came Ben's voice from the rear of the store. "" Say, old dear, rummage around some of those drawers for rubber gloves, will you? I'd hate to run into high voltage with this outfit."" ""Ah, here they are,"" came from Ben finally. "" Well, let's go."""
2286,"Trips to Mars and Venus—strange creatures.... It's not real—it's not dignified. Frankly, we question whether an institution like ours can afford to be connected with anything so—so ephemeral. After all ..."" He paused as sounds of a scuffle in the corridor penetrated the room and something or somebody was banged hard against the door. Bezdek, frowning, jumped up nervously and went to the door, opened it, looked out. ""What's going on out there?"" [SNIPPET] You can't go around slugging people either. Look at Ty out there."" ""Your servant will be all right,"" said the intruder, ""as will the others aboard this train. I can release them whenever you agree that my mission is to be taken seriously."" ""All right,"" said Bezdek, whose mind was nothing if not acrobatic. "" Suppose you are from Mars."
2287,"""That's a lot of hammering you're doing, son,"" I said. ""That's the only way I can get these boxes open, and don't call me son."" ""I don't like to disturb you, Mr. Gretch, but Mrs. Burroughs is a little upset over the way you acted today. I think you ought to come down for a cup of tea and get acquainted."" ""I know I was rude,"" he said, looking a little ashamed, ""but I have waited for years for a chance to get to work on my own, with no interference. I'll come down tomorrow, when I have got my equipment set up, and apologize to Mrs. Burroughs then."" [SNIPPET] Last Sunday, Mrs. Burroughs and I came home from church, about noon. She went inside through the front door to fix dinner. I walked around the house to look at the garden. And the moment I walked past the front of the house, I got the shock of my life. The house disappeared!"
2288,"“Ah yes. I forgot that she had achieved some fame in the outer world. Perhaps she has already met you?”  “Never,” said the young man coldly. “ [SNIPPET] Not so, at a concert, the despair of a shy British amateur in evening dress. The undergraduate on the dais, fumbling with his sheet of music while he predicted that only when he were “laid within the church-yard cold and grey” would his lady begin to pity him, seemed to the Duke rather ridiculous; but not half so ridiculous as the Warden. This fictitious love-affair was less nugatory than the actual humdrum for which Dr. Dobson had sold his soul to the devil. Also, little as one might suspect it, the warbler was perhaps expressing a genuine sentiment. Zuleika herself, belike, was in his thoughts."
2289,"But, like yourself, I had vision. And enthusiasm. And an intense desire to create. ""After I had taken my degrees, I went to work with almost abnormal intensity. With sufficient income to live as I desired, I fitted up my laboratory and concentrated on the thing I wanted to do. I spent years at it. [SNIPPET] We live. We devote ourselves to learning and creative thought. We study human relations, or we wander through the forests and the mountains, increasing the breadth and significance of our minds and emotions."" Selda's voice, rising suddenly after her long silence, startled me, and I looked at her, disturbed again by some subtle attraction exercised over me by her body. We were silent a while, then I relapsed into my inner questionings, and turned to Edvar. ""You must live under a sort of socialistic system,"" I said thoughtfully. """
2290,"Silent hidden computers assembled the answer, correlated, circuited a mechanical smile. Certainly—a child brought up with only three real children and three talking images in his universe could not distinguish between reality and appearance. On the screen, Adam saw Mecfather smile, the panel no longer red. The voice was quiet now and full of understanding. "" [SNIPPET] Mecmother should be warm and loving. Mecteacher appeared and asked Adam to call in the other children so the science lesson could start. He found them tanning in the sunroom, their unclothed bodies evenly browned from invisible light. They followed Adam without question, but seemed to take a long time doing it. Joseph insisted first in donning clothes, but he put on protective clothing first. Then, realizing the absurdity of it, he switched to his formality suit—the loose-fitting robe Mecteacher instructed the children to wear to lend dignity to the classwork."
2291,"In North America, the cities of Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott, with all that lay between, were already gone, their frantic populaces fleeing to the four points of the compass before that fateful orange tide. In South America, Rosario and Cordoba were within the flaming ring and Buenos Aires was threatened. In Europe, Moscow and its vast tributary plain had fallen before the invaders. In Asia, a veritable inland empire was theirs, reaching from Urga to the Khingan Mountains. In Africa, Southern Algeria and French Sudan, with their innumerable small villages and oases, were overrun. [SNIPPET] “And who can say a comet is not a disintegrated planet? Or suppose we take the other theory, that it is an eruption from some sun, ours or another. In any event, who can say no life can survive intense heat? Certainly these seeds—or call them meteorites, if you choose—came through the ordeal curiously unscathed.”"
2292,"Enforce terms rigidly. He was my best friend and trusted me with disposition of all this money. Shall attend to it sacredly. Heir must get rid of money left to him in given time. Out of respect to memory of uncle he must take no one into his confidence. Don't want world to think S. was damned fool. [SNIPPET] ""We might at least give out the impression that we are friends,"" she said quietly.  ""More easily said than done,"" he responded gloomily.  ""They are all looking at us and wondering.""  ""I don't blame them.""  ""We owe something to Mrs. Dan, I think."""
2293,"""Will she go with me?"" Alard challenged. "" You have to ask her; she has the right—"" ""Oh, I'll go with you, Alard,"" Lyddy interrupted joyfully. "" [SNIPPET] He didn't know why he was so anxious to remain on Erytheia. Mainly it was because for no good reason he found himself disliking the idea of making the Jump with her. "" If you'd rather, I could build you a city of your own, Lyddy,"" he tempted her. It was obvious that even if she had taken this seriously, it still wouldn't be what she wanted. "" I'd like to go away from here,"" she told him. "" Far away."" ""Just because you want a change—is that it?"""
2294,"The village road ended in the shallow of the aforesaid backwater. We crossed the road, and again almost without my will my hand raised the latch of a door in the wall, and we stood presently on a stone path which led up to the old house to which fate in the shape of Dick had so strangely brought me in this new world of men. My companion gave a sigh of pleased surprise and enjoyment; nor did I wonder, for the garden between the wall and the house was redolent of the June flowers, and the roses were rolling over one another with that delicious superabundance of small well-tended gardens which at first sight takes away all thought from the beholder save that of beauty. The blackbirds were singing their loudest, the doves were cooing on the roof-ridge, the rooks in the high elm-trees beyond were garrulous among the young leaves, and the swifts wheeled whining about the gables. And the house itself was a fit guardian for all the beauty of this heart of summer. [SNIPPET] I was very much shocked then to see how it was built-over and altered; and the other day we heard that the philistines were going to landscape-garden it. But what you were saying about the building being stopped and the trees growing is only too good news;—only you know—” At that point I suddenly remembered Dick’s date, and stopped short rather confused. The eager weaver didn’t notice my confusion, but said hastily, as if he were almost aware of his breach of good manners, “But, I say, how old are you?” Dick and the pretty girl both burst out laughing, as if Robert’s conduct were excusable on the grounds of eccentricity; and Dick said amidst his laughter: “Hold hard, Bob; this questioning of guests won’t do. Why, much learning is spoiling you."
2295,"Presently overtaking him, he cried aloud to him to turn, which instantly he did, and smote Sir Lionel so hard that horse and man went down forthwith. Then took he up Sir Lionel, and threw him bound over his own horse’s back; and so he served the three other knights, and rode them away to his own castle. There they were disarmed, stripped naked, and beaten with thorns, and afterwards thrust into a deep prison, where many more knights, also, made great moans and lamentations, saying, “Alas, alas! there is no man can help us but Sir Lancelot, for no other knight can match this tyrant Turquine, our conqueror.”  But all this while, Sir Lancelot lay sleeping soundly under the apple-tree. [SNIPPET] Whereat Sir Ector, turning to young Arthur, asked him—“How gottest thou the sword?”  “Sir,” said he, “I will tell you. When I went home to fetch my brother’s sword, I found nobody to deliver it to me, for all were abroad to the jousts. Yet was I loath to leave my brother swordless, and, bethinking me of this one, I came hither eagerly to fetch it for him, and pulled it out of the stone without any pain.”  Then said Sir Ector, much amazed and looking steadfastly on Arthur, “If this indeed be thus, ’tis thou who shalt be king of all this land—and God will have it so—for none but he who should be rightful Lord of Britain might ever draw this sword forth from that stone. But let me now with mine own eyes see thee put back the sword into its place and draw it forth again.”"
2296,"As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither could any of them understand a word he said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women. However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were Christians; that they abhorred eating men or women; and that they might be sure they would not be killed. As soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for it seems they were of several nations. The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to work for the men who had brought them away, to save their lives; at which they all fell a-dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate they were willing to work. The governor, who found that the having women among them would presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intended to do with these women, and how they intended to use them, whether as servants or as wives? One of the Englishmen answered, very boldly and readily, that they would use them as both; to which the governor said: “I am not going to restrain you from it—you are your own masters as to that; but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for that reason only, viz. [SNIPPET] We were, indeed, informed that a French man-of-war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone for the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France, I had some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way, and we heard no more of them. I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of places, journals of our voyage, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade-winds, &c.; it is enough to name the ports and places which we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our passages from one to another. We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where, though the people are fierce and treacherous, and very well armed with lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with them a while. They treated us very civilly; and for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, scissors, &c., they brought us eleven good fat bullocks, of a middling size, which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship’s use."
2297,"Tensely, counting the seconds, they waited for the sunrise…. And now, as they waited, suddenly a sinister tinge of orange suffused the rosy hues of the east. “The Fire Ants!” cried Joan, shrinking. “ They’ve seen us! They’re coming!” [SNIPPET] While this was taking place, Professor Wentworth was re-developing the rest of the negatives. At last all had been salvaged, even those taken in the terrific heat over that weird glass city out there, and Jim was preparing to bear them back to Overton in triumph. He had thanked the kindly professor from the bottom of his heart, had even told him something of what he had been telling Joan. There remained but to put one last question, then go. “Summing it all up, what do you make of those nightmares?” he asked. “"
2298,"Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at shoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a wide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes avoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking up inquiringly at his master. ""Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!"" the Butcher called. [SNIPPET] ""It doesn't matter what you think now,"" Hal said with finality. "" You'll have an altogether different opinion when you're six."" ""Well, what if I will?"" the Butcher snapped back. "" You don't have to keep telling me about it, do you?"""
2299,"And what do you mean I'm disqualified from the contest? What's wrong with me?"" ""Not a thing, Miss Manson."" He grinned happily at her. "" But if you can stand having dinner with a man in an old-fashioned suit, I'll tell you why Mother America should be a contented cow instead of a tantalizing tigress."" ""Hm, this is one orbit I haven't travelled."" [SNIPPET] What's wrong with it?"" ""You'd never understand and I haven't time to tell you. What I want to know is, who gave you the right to use my name in this silly Mother America contest. And you,"" she turned on the Dee Lish agent, ""quit gawping at me. I'm not going to blast off. Who are you anyway?"" ""Miss Manson, please!"""
2300,"I'll just go to my room and open the soundproofing."" There were still no tears in her eyes. I thought of a thousand things to say: Don't you want to catch a glimpse of Hal in the crowd going up the ramp? Mightn't they let the kids wave a last farewell to their folks listening and watching in? Mightn't something in the President's speech make us feel a little better? But I heard myself saying, ""Never mind, Lucy. Don't go. [SNIPPET] Babies don't have to be born in hospitals, you know; our ancestors had them right at home. She's strong and healthy and I know what to do. Then we'll come back here and we'll have a baby with us that we adopted wherever we were. Nobody will ever know."" ""Look,"" I said in a voice I tried to keep from rising. "" There are four billion people on Earth and about 28 billion in the colonized Solar planets."
2301,"""All right, that leaves me, the tape-thief. The last spools are in the seismographs now, and will start running out in seventeen hours. The tractors will start out on their last rounds in sixteen, and should be back in roughly a week. Will, does that give you enough to figure the weights we rockhounds can have on the return trip?"" The Albireo's captain nodded. "" [SNIPPET] I can do the work here; none of this stuff is very heavy."" Zaino hesitated as he swung out of the cab. True, there wasn't too much to be moved, and it wasn't very heavy in Mercury's gravity, and he really should be at the radio; but the thirty-nine-year-old mineralogist was a middle-aged lady by his standards, and shouldn't be allowed to carry heavy packages. ""Get along, Arnie!"" the middle-aged lady interrupted this train of thought. """
2302,"12. The tribe rode on tranquilly. There would be new legends of Kao-Wagwattl, after what had occurred. Many were the stories, and I relayed them to Campbell, at the ship, who faithfully recorded them all. There was a tragedy to be added. It could not have been otherwise. [SNIPPET] ""You mean—"" ""I mean that you and I are the only two human animals on this planet with eyebrows and eyelashes. When Omosla's baby arrives without a trace of an eyelash, that might go a long way toward convincing—"" ""You'll help me fight it, then?"""
2303,"She, instantly springing to the ground, advanced towards her son, and said: “What dost thou here in this little square chamber? As the Dives are become subject to thy beck, I expected to have found thee on the throne of the pre-adamite kings.” “Execrable woman!” answered the Caliph; “cursed be the day thou gavest me birth! [SNIPPET] Alboufaki and my negresses are waiting.” The Caliph had nothing to offer in reply; he wished his mother a prosperous journey, and ate on till he had finished his supper. At midnight the camp broke up, amidst the flourishing of trumpets and other martial instruments; but loud indeed must have been the sound of the tymbals to overpower the blubbering of the Emir and his long-beards, who, by an excessive profusion of tears, had so far exhausted the radical moisture, that their eyes shrivelled up in their sockets, and their hairs dropped off by the roots. Nouronihar, to whom such a symphony was painful, did not grieve to get out of hearing; she accompanied the Caliph in the imperial litter, where they amused themselves with imagining the splendour which was soon to surround them. The other women, overcome with dejection, were dolefully rocked in their cages, whilst Dilara consoled herself with anticipating the joy of celebrating the rites of fire on the stately terraces of Istakar. In four days they reached the spacious valley of Rocnabad."
2304,"And there I let it drop. Yet, I have told you this, as showing how the matter was regarded in the fo'cas'le. Still, it did not occupy our minds very long; for, as I have said, there were further developments. The three following nights passed quietly; and then, on the fourth, all those curious signs and hints culminated suddenly in something extraordinarily grim. [SNIPPET] he asked, quietly. "" The two bunks are full."" ""You'll have to put him down on the deck by the lower bunk,"" replied the Skipper. As they carried him away, I heard the Old Man make a sound that was almost a groan. The rest of the men had gone forrard, and I do not think he realised that I was standing by h ""My God! O, my God!"""
2305,"There are a lot of funny things here on this island but there is nothing to be afraid of—except this!"" He patted the stock of the stumpy little gun he held. "" And there's enough stuff up there to make all of us rich; we'll have everything we can ever want."" A glow crept into Retch's eyes as he spoke. [SNIPPET] From this place, as the centuries passed, there might be fed out, little by little, knowledge that would change the world; knowledge that would change the hearts and the minds of men; knowledge that would eliminate poverty, stop wars, knowledge that would help the human race become what it must one day be."" The glow on Rozeno's face was bright. The dream he dreamed was suddenly, in Parker's mind, a living, breathing vital hope, the hope[Pg 144] of all honest men everywhere, that tomorrow might be better! ""Would you, my son, help me achieve that dream? Will you go back through the veil and explain to some of your greatest scientists what we have here?"""
2306,"But I never took more than two or three drinks. Something had happened. Then I remembered the stranger. We had all been sitting about the lounge, talking of something. What had we been discussing? [SNIPPET] His first greeting was curious. ""So you are here,"" he said. His voice was small but cool, penetrating and metallic. I thought of fine steel wires."
2307,"As he raised his voice in weak protest, the pain ceased and he relaxed, spent. His eyes continued shut, as though the lids were gummed down. Failing in many attempts to open them, he quested food, found it, and consoled himself with it. Occasionally plaintive voices babbled unintelligibly, arousing him. Always, if he listened, he heard a gentle murmur reply to the voices. And then everything was quiet. [SNIPPET] It seems that not only the readers, but the editors and writers as well, cannot or will not see anything beyond their own perverted models. Just as one example which I remember very well, look how BRAVE NEW WORLD, the admirable and really important novel by Huxley, was received a few years ago. It was Clark Ashton Smith, I believe, who mentioned it as embodying some of Huxley's ""habitual pornography""—simply, stunning P. Schyler Miller; whom, I might mention, I consider as one of the most intellectual authors and fans. And, reviewing the book, C.A. Brandt also decried its preoccupation with sex, but said complacently that it might, at least, bring to the attention of people that there was such a thing as the science-fictionists and their so-called literature. Of all the damned nonsense! BRAVE NEW WORLD was, as a matter of fact, a satire on sex, and of FAR MORE IMPORTANCE than to ""bring to the attention of people that there is such a thing as sci-fiction."""
2308,"The choice is yours. But think on who you are."" The mother slipped away and left Juba alone in the quiet precinct of Juno, watching how the little fire caught at the silver backs of turned leaves when the wind blew. Yes, Juba knew who she was, though they had never made it an important thing to be a ruler. [SNIPPET] ""Juba,"" Mother said with a smile, pulling the girl's cloak, for she liked to please them, ""would you like him for a pet? Or your personal servant?"" ""No,"" she said, and she could feel the breath sharp in her lungs. "" I would rather.... He would make a good spectacle in the gladiatorial contests. He would look well with a sword through his heart."" She would not picture him a corpse. She put the picture from her mind."
2309,"""Your degrees were in physics, were they not, Mr. Rush?"" Now the touch of malice came. ""That is correct."" He sat down in one of the wooden chairs. "" I quit working long before the witch hunts came. [SNIPPET] They will have intelligence and curiosity that increases as they mature. They will not be blinded by the senses—the easy way. The first thing they will discover is each other. What else might they then discover?"
2310,"""I'm going to open Uncle Izzy's ship from the inside."" Rene lighted a fresh cigarette from the old one and let the smoke out of his nose. It gave rather the impression of a bull resting between picadors. ""Can you show me, on the outside, approximately where the button is that you push on the inside to unseal the ship?"" I inquired casually. ""I can show you exactly."" [SNIPPET] That bird's lying. It's impossible."" ""Shut up!"" I yelled at him. "" The poem's not over."" I read on, somewhat ashamed of having to say such inhospitable words to a dodo who had been, after all, cooperating with me. ""'Take thy beak from out my heart,/And take thy form from off my door!'/Quoth the Dodo...."""
2311,"All such degrees have been stricken from the records."" He looked down and John saw that his eyes no longer hid the hate. "" If your wife dies I doubt that any court would allow you to keep custody of these children."" A year before—even six months and John would not have protested. Now he had to make the effort. "" They are my children—such as they are—and I will fight any attempt to take them from me."" The Juvenile Man smiled without humor. "" [SNIPPET] He opened the door and motioned them in and then followed. He heard the Juvenile man catch his breath a little. The twins were playing again. They had left their vigil at the bedside and they were moving swiftly around the small living room, their hands and arms and legs moving in some synchronized game that had no meaning—their movements quick and sure—their faces showing some intensity, some purpose. They moved with grace, avoiding obstructions."
2312,"""Can't think of anything else?"" the captain asked. "" Well, neither can I, but of course it's not my field. I'd give a year's pay if I could. How long before they should be back in range?"" ""About four days. A hundred hours, give or take a few. [SNIPPET] ""We've just come in sight of the flow. It's about five hundred yards ahead. We'll get as close as seems safe, and I'll try to make sure whether it's really lava or just mud."" ""Mud? Is that possible?"
2313,"Now we had seen Red Harald pass through the streets, with a white banner borne before him, to show that he came peaceably as for this time; but I know he was thinking of other things than peace.  And he was called Red Harald first at this time, because over all his arms he wore a great scarlet cloth, that fell in heavy folds about his horse and all about him. Then, as he passed our house, some one pointed it out to him, rising there with its carving and its barred marble, but stronger than many a castle on the hill-tops, and its great overhanging battlement cast a mighty shadow down the wall and across the street; and above all rose the great tower, or banner floating proudly from the top, whereon was emblazoned on a white ground a blue cross, and on a blue ground four white lilies. And now faces were gazing from all the windows, and all the battlements were thronged; so Harald turned, and rising in his stirrups, shook his clenched fist at our house; natheless, as he did so, the east wind, coming down the street, caught up the corner of that scarlet cloth and drove it over his face, and therewithal disordering his long black hair, well nigh choked him, so that he bit both his hair and that cloth. [SNIPPET] But I could not answer a word, but all the time strange knowledge, strange feelings were filling my brain and my heart, she said: ""You are tired; rest, and dream happily.""  So she sat by me, and sang to lull me to sleep, while I turned on my elbow, and watched the waving of her throat: and the singing of all the poets I had ever heard, and of many others too, not born till years long after I was dead, floated all about me as she sang, and I did indeed dream happily.  When I awoke it was the time of the cold dawn, and the colours were gathering themselves together, whereat in fatherly approving fashion the sun sent all across the east long bars of scarlet and orange that after faded through yellow to green and blue. And she sat by me still; I think she had been sitting there and singing all the time; all through hot yesterday, for I had been sleeping day-long and night-long, all through the falling evening under moonlight and starlight the night through.  And now it was dawn, and I think too that neither of us had moved at all; for the last thing I remembered before I went to sleep was the tips of her fingers brushing my cheek, as she knelt over me with downdrooping arm, and still now I felt them there. Moreover she was just finishing some fainting measure that died before it had time to get painful in its passion.  Dear Lord!"
2314,"Can’t pancake here, or I’ll be a flapjack!” At an altitude of less than a thousand he levelled off again, eased on down, fully expecting to feel his plane burst into flames. But though his eyebrows crisped and the gas must have boiled, the sturdy little plane made it. On a long last glide, he put her wheels down on the sandy desert floor, a bare half mile beyond that searing hell. The heat was still terrific but endurable now. He dared breathe deeper; he found his head clearing. But what was the good of it? [SNIPPET] “I know.” The professor was not as calm as he pretended. “ We have released some of their actinic rays captured by the negative, in prying loose our excess silver. Later I shall repeat the process and capture some of that vapor for analysis. At present, let us have a look at the negative already treated.” He lifted the anode from the solution now, removed the negative, and held it up."
2315,"Do not try to harm me or the wrath of those who have Passed On will turn against you.” When I said this, I turned to jab a claw at the other priests, using the motion to cover my flicking a coin grenade toward them. It blew a nice hole in the floor with a great show of noise and smoke. The First Lizard knew I was talking sense then and immediately called a meeting of the shamans. It, of course, took place in the public bathtub and I had to join them there. [SNIPPET] If I were an ignorant aborigine of Earth and I ran into a Spican, who looks like a two-foot gob of dried shellac, I would immediately leave the scene. However, if the Spican was wearing a suit of plastiflesh that looked remotely humanoid, I would at least stay and talk to him. This was what I was aiming to do with the Centaurians. When the head was done, I peeled it off and attached it to an attractive suit of green plastic, complete with tail. I was really glad they had tails."
2316,"Her long, lustrous hair following her glorious head in a golden wake, like the track sown in heaven by a falling star, seems to quench my most burning phrases with its splendors. If all the bees of Hybla nestled upon my lips, they would still sing but hoarsely the wondrous harmonies of outline that enclosed her form. She swept out from between the rainbow-curtains of the cloud-trees into the broad sea of light that lay beyond. Her motions were those of some graceful naiad, cleaving, by a mere effort of her will, the clear, unruffled waters that fill the chambers of the sea. [SNIPPET] I hastily expressed my satisfaction, and escaped hurriedly into the cool night air. I walked home with but one thought possessing me—how to obtain a diamond of the immense size required. My entire means multiplied a hundred times over would have been inadequate to its purchase. Besides, such stones are rare, and become historical. I could find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs. 4. The Eye of M"
2317,"Sure. I know.”  From then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this strange Southland dog. [SNIPPET] Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her, snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath the bristling mass of bodies.  So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw François, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them."
2318,"We have a cause and an effect. Something is keeping us in the ship. Corollary: We—or perhaps the ship—we're not welcome."" ""Men of Earth,"" quoted Ives, in an excellent imitation of the accentless English they had heard on the radio, ""welcome to our planet."" ""They're kidding,"" said Johnny heartily, rising to his feet. He dropped the control wheel with a clang and shoved it carelessly aside with his foot. "" [SNIPPET] Now that was a real educational remark, Martin, old chap,"" he said. He lay down and stretched luxuriously. "" That I can understand. You may wear my famous maroon zipsuit."""
2319,"The door gave suddenly; they tumbled through. Into a gray twilight they struggled, shot with little dashes of rain that had beaten the valley to mud. ""Cheez!"" said Marta, struggling through the gelatinous stuff. "" If I live through this, I'll live to be a million."" [SNIPPET] ""It sure is one first-class heller,"" agreed Ben. "" Are you far enough down to duck it now?"" ""I think so, unless they can put it through the hills or chase us with it. Do you suppose those dodos thought that up themselves?"" ""Can't tell. They're right on their toes, though."
2320,"Dash it all, I'm blundering again! I mean—I mean—don't you know——""  Edra laughed and gave it up. Then we all laughed; for now evidently my blundering did not so much matter, since I had shed my outer integument, and come forth like a snake (with a divided tail) in a brand new skin. [SNIPPET] In vain I scanned the horizon, waiting impatiently to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine. This troubled me not a little, for I had no idea that I had drifted so far from civilization in my search for specimens, or whatever it was that brought me to this pretty, primitive wilderness. Not quite a wilderness, however, for there, within a short hour's walk of the hill, stood the one great stone mansion, close to the river I had mentioned. There were also horses and cows in sight, and a number of scattered sheep were grazing on the hillside beneath me."
2321,"Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain's base, weakened by the lethal fetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-gray, and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills. The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave and quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering. [SNIPPET] Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned close by. ""Gawd,"" he gasped, ""I telled 'em not ter go daown into the glen, an' I never thought nobody'd dew it with them tracks an' that smell an' the whippoorwills a-screechin' daown thar in the dark o' noonday...."" A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course."
2322,"It'll be enough if you can listen for the next hour or two."" Zaino made no answer, suspecting with some justice that anything he said would be wrong. Each made final checks on the other's suit; then they descended one more level to the airlock. This occupied part of the same deck as the fusion plants, below the wings and reaction mass tanks but above the main engine. [SNIPPET] You knew we couldn't reach as far this way with the radios. Didn't you think of that in advance?"" ""I didn't think of it, any more than you would have. It was bad luck, but I'm not grousing about it. Let's get on with this job."" Hargedon nodded with approval, and possibly with some surprise, and the tractor hummed on its way."
2323,"Ed Dukas would be angry and puzzled. For it had seemed that those visions, going on without end, could bring joy forever. ""You'll understand sometime, Eddie,"" his mother would say, consoling him. "" What happens to you by sensipsych is just make-believe. What we call recorded sensory experience. [SNIPPET] Eddie shut his eyes and buried his face in his pillow. This reflex action, partly as natural as terror and partly the result of training for emergencies at school, saved his vision. He might have screamed, had he been able to find his voice. Distantly, he heard human sounds that increased the sickness in his stomach. A gentle scene and mood, product of science, had been utterly shattered by forces of the same origin. He did not see the fuzzy blob of incandescence that bloomed in the sky and expanded slowly for many seconds."
2324,"Take two children, blind them, make them deaf to all sound, cut away their voices. They are identical twins, facing the same environment, sharing the same heredity of blasted chromosomes. They will have intelligence and curiosity that increases as they mature. They will not be blinded by the senses—the easy way. [SNIPPET] For another eternity he hunted the muddy fields, the small barn and outbuildings. The clutch of fear made him shout their names, though he knew they could not hear. And then, suddenly, all fear was gone—like a summer squall near the sea, with the sun close behind. It was as if their hands had reached out and touched him and brought the strange feeling again."
2325,"""The trouble with this,"" Monty replied, ""is that there are too many people about. My fairyland is to be just a little different.""  ""Your fairyland, Monty, will be built of gold and paved with silver. You will sit all day cutting coupons in an office of alabaster.""  ""Peggy, do you too think me vulgar? [SNIPPET] ""No, Mr. Brewster, it is absolutely genuine. Here is a telegram from the Probate Court in Sedgwick's home county, received in response to a query from us. It says that the will is to be filed for probate and that Mr. Sedgwick was many times a millionaire. This statement, which he calls an inventory, enumerates his holdings and their value, and the footing shows $6,345,000 in round numbers. The investments, you see, are gilt-edged. There is not a bad penny in all those millions."""
2326,"You saw him today."" ""But he looks like you,"" John protested. ""He should,"" Gloria said. "" He's his."" ""But ..."" John hesitated. "" [SNIPPET] ""Yes, the one who wrote The Canals of Mars and takes the female lead."" ""Roaring rockets! If she wins what a blastoff that will be."" ""I don't understand."""
2327,"“Sir,” said he, “as for that, I beseech thee of thy mercy to forgive it her, and for my part may God pardon her as I do; and so I pray thee grant me my boon, and for God’s sake hold thee to thy promise.”  “If it must be so,” said the king, “take thou her life, for to thee I give it, and go and do with her as thou wilt.”  Then went young Tristram to the fire and loosed the queen from all her bonds and delivered her from death.  And after a great while by his good means the king again forgave and lived in peace with her, though never more in the same lodgings.  Anon was Tristram sent abroad to France in care of one named Governale. And there for seven years he learned the language of the land, and all knightly exercises and gentle crafts, and especially was he foremost in music and in hunting, and was a harper beyond all others. And when at nineteen years of age he came back to his father, he was as lusty and strong of body and as noble of heart as ever man was seen. [SNIPPET] Then came forth other angels also—two bearing burning candles, and the third a towel, and the fourth a spear which bled marvellously, the drops wherefrom fell into a box he held in his left hand. Anon the bishop took the wafer up to consecrate it, and at the lifting up, they saw the figure of a Child, whose visage was as bright as any fire, which smote itself into the midst of the wafer and vanished, so that all saw the flesh made bread.  Thereat the bishop went to Galahad and kissed him, and bade him go and kiss his fellows; and said, “Now, servants of the Lord, prepare for food such as none ever yet were fed with since the world began.”  With that he vanished, and the knights were filled with a great dread and prayed devoutly."
2328,"I have the same feeling with every step I take, as though the unseen surface were endowed with arms capable of reaching out and grabbing me."" ""I feel it, too,"" said Jeter's fingers. "" But I'm not afraid of fingers in the usual sense. I don't think of hands strangling us, or ripping us to shreds, but of questing—well, call them tentacles, which may clasp us with gentleness even, and absorb us, and annihilate us!"" [SNIPPET] Their fear had left them utterly when it would have been natural for them to be stunned by it. Eyer thrust out his hand to cut the motor. Jeter stayed it. ""I've an idea,"" he said softly; ""let it run. We'll learn something more about the sensitiveness of this material."""
2329,"I didn't really mean adventure, though; all I want is something to do besides betting whether the next quake will come in one minute or five. I haven't even had to fix a suit-radio since we touched down. How about my going out with one of the tractors on this last trip, at least?"" ""It's all right with me,"" replied Rowson, ""but Dr. Mardikian runs the professional part of this operation. I require that Spurr, Trackman, Hargedon and Aiello go as drivers, since without them even a minor mechanical problem would be more than an adventure. As I recall it, Dr. Harmon, Dr. Schlossberg, Dr. Marini and Dr. Mardikian are scheduled to go; but if any one of them is willing to let you take his or her place, I certainly don't mind."" [SNIPPET] ""Excuse me, Doctor,"" cut in Hargedon. "" Our suits need servicing, or at least mine will if you want me to drive you. Perhaps Arnie can help you load for a while, if you don't think it's too important for him to get at the radio—"" ""Of course."
2330,"To his surprise, the translation of this was greeted by unmistakable twitterings of gladness. The members of the adulterous group turned to each other with excited gestures, and Weaver saw a pairing-off process begin, with much discussion. He asked Mark about it later, as they were leaving the village. "" How is it that they did this thing before—for more variety, as you say—and yet seem so glad to stop?"" Mark's answer was: ""They very glad to do whatever thing you say. [SNIPPET] The guns, built with so much labor, the enormous guns that could throw a shell two hundred miles. The crews, manning them night and day to destroy the first ship that came in from space. And they had never meant to use them! Anger fought with caution."
2331,"""No one ever does come here,"" she replied. Her manner had changed, becoming at once more wary and less agitated, though still eerily curious. ""It startled me tremendously to find this place,"" he blundered on. "" Especially the road and the car. Why, this island can't be more than a quarter of a mile wide."" ""The road goes down to the wharf,"" she explained, ""and up to the top of the island, where my aunts have a tree-house."" He tore his mind away from the picture of a woman dressed like Queen Mary clambering up a tree. "" [SNIPPET] Then he was dropping down the rocks, his lanky limbs now moving smoothly enough. To the landward side of the spine, the water was fairly still. It even began with another deep cove, in which he glimpsed the spiny spheres of sea urchins. But from seaward the waves chopped in, sprinkling his trousers to the knees and making him wince pleasurably at the thought of what vast wings of spray and towers of solid water must crash up from here in a storm. He crossed the rocks at a trot, ran up a short grassy slope, raced through a fringe of trees—and came straight up against an eight-foot fence of heavy mesh topped with barbed wire and backed at a short distance with high, heavy shrubbery."
2332,"When he had all data noted on the board, he started his mathematics. He was right in the middle of a laborious equation when he stumbled over a thorium crystal. He went headlong, shooting like a rocket three feet above the ground. His board flew away at a tangent. His stylus sped out of his glove like a miniature projectile, and the slide rule clanged against his bubble. [SNIPPET] The Connie fighting craft looked like three globes strung evenly on a steel tube. The middle globe was larger than the end ones, and it was transparent. From it projected the barrels of two kinds of weapons—explosive and ultrasonic. Five men usually rode in the middle ball. One piloted. The other four were gunners. The end globes were pierced by five large holes."
2333,"In all this time, he never left the Clytemnestra System. As soon as he was satisfied that his former neighbors were not going to set the law on his trail, he had no desire to go away. It wasn't place-liking that kept him; it was dread of the Jump. Most spacemen never do quite get over their dread of the hyperspace Jump, but with Len the dread amounted almost to a mania. He was ashamed of the feeling, especially since he suspected he'd picked up that extra dollop of terror from the creatures on the native planet. Self-respecting colonials didn't associate with non-humans, but during those first years of fear that his fellow men were hunting him, he'd felt safe only with the flluska. [SNIPPET] But there's more. Somehow, ever since we've been married, I keep feeling all the time like—like I'm being watched."" His smile was strained. "" Well, naturally, in 'Rytheia City, people will tend to—watch. Let's go far away from where people are. There's an island on this planet, way off in the western seas. I'll buy you that island, Lyddy."
2334,"It wasn't the first time he had been called upon to hear Jeter think out loud. ""It all ties up somehow,"" repeated Jeter, ""and I intend to find out how."" But he didn't find out. Strange stories kept appearing. The three Chinese scientists still had not communicated with the outside world. The chap out in Arizona had now so elaborated on his yarn that nobody believed him and the public lost interest—all save Jeter, who was on the trail of a queer idea. [SNIPPET] They did not go farther because they wished to make sure that the enemy did not dislodge the plane and nullify all their work. ""They won't be able to,"" said Jeter, ""for that motor is pulling against the wheels and holding them so tight against the side of that door that a hundred men couldn't budge the plane. But we can't take chances."" Quickly the partners slipped into their suits, adjusted their oxygen tanks and parachutes."
2335,"We were a few miles off, so the sound—when it finally got to us—was muted by distance, but it was still a lulu. ""And to think,"" Artie murmured, ""that this is happening because we tried to make it noiseless!"" ""What I'm worried about,"" I said sickly, ""is that new cloud of dust rising from the latest debris. There are crumbs of two smashed buildings in it, Artie. And in roughly twenty minutes the process is going to repeat, and there'll be crumbs from four labs in the air; two labs that'll be the second duplicate of the original, and two that'll be the first duplicate of the original-plus-first-duplicate!"" Artie shook his head sadly. "" Crumbs from six, Burt. [SNIPPET] We both finished in a dead heat. I unlocked the door of the lab, blinked hard against the sting of warm yellow sunlight after a week of cool blue fluorescents, and just as I wheezed, ""Got it,"" Artie was counterpointing with, ""We'll call it The Uuaa!"" ( He made four syllables out of it.) ""The Oo-oo-ah-ah?"" I glottaled. "" In honor of the fiftieth state, or what? I know 'aa' is a type of lava, but what the hell's 'uu', besides the noise a man makes getting into an overheated bath?"""
2336,"""What are you doing?"" her face paled. He turned to her, smiling. "" Lazar was wondering how Sanderson and McLean escaped. You were on the master list of suspects. I was waiting for you to confess."" Lynn stiffened. "" [SNIPPET] She shut the door. Lazar looked down at the dead Harry Horn. ""You said dead or alive,"" Lynn reminded Lazar. "" You owe me ten thousand credits."" ""What happened?"" Lazar snapped at her."
2337,"He rose from the table and dragged a chair to the hearth. Once more Marguerite was terribly tempted to go to him, for time was getting on; Desgas might be back at any moment with his men. Percy did not know that and . . . oh! how horrible it all was—and how helpless she felt. [SNIPPET] “Since then?”  “I did not lose sight of him through supper. When we all came upstairs again, Lady Portarles buttonholed him and started on the subject of pretty Mlle. Suzanne de Tournay."
2338,"A couple of yards away from the sandy beach the fishes dropped the cord from their mouths and swam to one side, while the iron boat, being now under way, continued to move until its prow grated upon the sands.  Ervic leaned over the side and said to the fishes: ""What next?""  ""You will find upon the sand,"" said the silverfish, ""a copper kettle, which the Su-dic forgot when he went away. Cleanse it thoroughly in the water of the lake, for it has had poison in it. When it is cleaned, fill it with fresh water and hold it over the side of the boat, so that we three may swim into the kettle. [SNIPPET] So Ervic jumped out of the boat and found the copper kettle. Carrying it a little way down the beach, he washed it well, scrubbing away every drop of the poison it had contained with sand from the shore.  Then he went back to the boat.  Ervic's comrades were still sound asleep and knew nothing of the three fishes or what strange happenings were taking place about them. Ervic dipped the kettle in the lake, holding fast to the handle until it was under water. The gold and silver and bronze fishes promptly swam into the kettle. The young Skeezer then lifted it, poured out a little of the water so it would not spill over the edge, and said to the fishes: ""What next?"""
2339,"“Yeah, yeah. But where’d all this translation griff put—” “Don’t be impatient. Glass-blowing culture meant they were just out of the primitive stage. That, we could control. Next, he said their moon was Chiranachuruso, translated as The Limb of Victory. [SNIPPET] I know I’m a recent convert, but—” “You want out?” “I didn’t say that. I just want to know why I’m—” “Because the bigdomes fed a set of requirements into one of their iron monsters. Your card popped out. They were looking for somebody capable, dependable ... and ... expendable!”"
2340,"Nobody seems to have seen anyone go to her room or leave it. Our police department must have fallen on evil days indeed when twenty crack plain-clothes men cannot keep one woman under surveillance.” Something was radically wrong, but Bentley could not piece the whole story together, simply because he had been out of touch for so many hours that the thread of it had slipped from his fingers. Suddenly Bentley noticed that a solitary man was watching him curiously, a dawning amazement in his face. Bentley roused himself and saw that he was standing against the mesh, fingers hooked into it above his head, his weight on his left leg, his right foot crossed over his left, his head thoughtfully bowed. 2 [SNIPPET] The sight of one eye had been destroyed. Bentley watched him, sprawled now on the sidewalk, surrounded by a group of men. The man was dying, no question about that. The talons, which had scored him, had bitten deeply and he was destined to bleed to death soon even if the wounds were not otherwise mortal. Bentley noticed something clutched tightly in the man’s right hand––something that sent a chill through his body despite the heat of a mid-July noon. The officer, apparently, had not noticed it. Soon a clanging bell announced the arrival of an ambulance, and as the crowd stepped aside to clear the way, Bentley bent over the dying man."
2341,"He picked it up. "" D, no agent shall enter into a marriage contract with any native.... H-m-m. You're not trying to warn me, are you, Captain Linden? Or are you warning yourself?"" At that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred vision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her—yes, she must have haunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her features more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the party of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the attack. [SNIPPET] As the light of morning came on we could distinguish the immense box-shaped scales that covered its sides. Clouds of sponge-trees rose and fell around it. Unrooted vegetation would sift downward, to be bumped into the air again, or to be rolled under. Small fires were continually being ignited by friction, and often smothered before they were well started. Sometimes the burning would creep up around the curved sides, only to be snuffed out by the surface-breathing of the massive thing."
2342,"When the car came within the sensible attraction of the moon, its velocity would gradually increase as they approached each other."" G. ""Always supposing the aim of the gun to have been exact. You might hit the moon, with its large disc and comparatively short range, provided no wandering meteorite diverted the bullet from its course; but it would be impossible to hit a planet, such as Venus or Mars, a mere point of light, and thirty or forty million miles away, especially as both the earth and planet are in rapid motion. A flying rifle-shot from a lightning express at a distant swallow would have more chance of success. If you missed the mark, the projectile would wheel round the planet, and either become its satellite or return towards the earth like that of Jules Verne in his fascinating romance."" I. ""Jules Verne, and other writers on this subject, appear to have assumed that all the initial effort should come from the cannon. [SNIPPET] I had scarcely time to look about me when a strange and wonderful melody of most entrancing sweetness echoed through the cavern. ""Siloo, Siloo!"" cried Alumion softly, and the music, which I cannot compare to any earthly strain, ceased in a moment. Presently I was more than startled to see in the gloomier background of the cavern a great white serpent glide like a ghost along the floor and come straight towards us. His milk-white body was speckled all over with jewelled scales, and shone with a pale blue phosphorescence; his eyes blazed in his head like twin carbuncles, and in spite of my instinctive dread of snakes, I could not help admiring his repulsive beauty. Presently he reared his long neck, and faced us with his forked tongue playing out and in."
2343,"Hundreds of miles a minute was the speed my instrument had to be regulated to, in order to keep an object on Earth in view—the motion of the liner was insignificant! Moving the current eastward over the Atlantic Ocean, I discovered that darkness in no way hindered my view of objects on Earth's surface. The reproduction on the lens, however, presented quite a different appearance to that which I had witnessed while observing the part of Earth illuminated by the sun. The beautiful colors which contributed so much realism to the picture were now replaced by a sombre gray tone, greatly resembling a photograph in appearance. So absorbed had I become in all that this wonderful instrument revealed to me of the different phases of life on Earth, that I forgot all else, until, with a start, I realized that someone was moving about in the large room which contained the virator that I had recently left. I was filled with apprehension. Who could it be? [SNIPPET] Without waiting to be questioned, Reon offered me a slip of paper on which I observed Almos' handwriting. ""I carefully followed your instructions, Almos, regarding the virator, and, half an hour later, I turned off the current of super-radium. I was just preparing to leave. You are late in returning, are you not?"" While Reon thus spoke, I had gained time to glance hastily over the instructions that Almos had written upon the slip of paper which I held in my hand, and I now replied, with every nerve strung in an effort to appear calm: ""I am, Reon, a whole hour late, and very sorry, indeed, to have kept you waiting so long. But now, my good fellow, you must be off; I will not detain you a moment longer than it takes to thank you for your kindness from the bottom of my heart."""
2344,"Then everything became very real. That was what the pact was for—to make sure they didn't collide. Every spaceship had, locked in the captain's cabin, charts of that other universe—charts which gave, in normspace terms, the coordinates of the hyperspace worlds. That way, when a ship made the Jump, there would be no danger of her materializing inside one of the alien planets and destroying both. Even touching one of the hyper-worlds could have a disastrous effect. [SNIPPET] She went on talking in this vein, but Mattern ignored her and turned his attention to the boy. "" I suppose you told her not to eat or drink anything so she'd see the hyperspacer?"" Raines nodded, his face essaying contempt but imperfectly concealing terror. ""And I suppose you yourself did the same thing, not knowing the men weren't going to be drugged this trip?"""
2345,"Guldran's pulse leaped. He yelled again, ""Food!"" The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. [SNIPPET] said the last woman on earth.

2346,"Let me try a flight with it."" ""Teddy Kaner first,"" Biff announced. "" He spotted it while you were all watching the flashing lights, only he didn't say anything."" Kaner slipped the ring with the black thread over his finger and started to step back. [SNIPPET] No one can be interested in a thing like that—a fractional weight decrease in a clumsy model, certainly not enough to lift the weight of the generator. No one wrapped up in massive fuel consumption, tons of lift and such is going to have time to worry about a crackpot who thinks he has found a minor slip in Newton's laws."" ""You think they will now?"" the young man asked, cracking his knuckles impatiently. ""I know they will. The tensile strength of that thread is correctly adjusted to the weight of the model."
2347,"The next day the Sorceress and the Wizard again entered the boat and made it submerge and go to the marble door, which they tried in various ways to open, but without success.  ""We shall have to abandon this attempt, I think,"" said Glinda. "" The easiest way to raise the island would be for us to gain admittance to the Dome and then descend to the basement and see in what manner Coo-ee-oh made the entire island sink or rise at her command. It naturally occurred to me that the easiest way to gain admittance would be by having the boat take us into the basement through the marble door from which Coo-ee-oh launched it. But there must be other ways to get inside the Dome and join Ozma and Dorothy, and such ways we must find by study and the proper use of our powers of magic.""  ""It won't be easy,"" declared the Wizard, ""for we must not forget that Ozma herself understands considerable magic, and has doubtless tried to raise the island or find other means of escape from it and failed."" [SNIPPET] A moment later there arose to the surface a beautiful White Swan. This Swan was of large size, very gracefully formed, and scattered all over its white feathers were tiny diamonds, so thickly placed that as the rays of the morning sun fell upon them the entire body of the Swan glistened like one brilliant diamond. The head of the Diamond Swan had a bill of polished gold and its eyes were two sparkling amethysts.  ""Hooray!"" cried the Su-dic, dancing up and down with wicked glee. "" My poor wife, Rora, is avenged at last. You made her a Golden Pig, Coo-ee-oh, and now I have made you a Diamond Swan."
2348,"Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.  Soon after the migration to the “warm rivers,” in which he had taken part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of Boguchárovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward respected him and jestingly called him “the Minister.” [SNIPPET] As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.  Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio."
2349,"She was horrified. I shook her with a superhuman strength. ""Tell me!"" I shouted, ""Tell me—Or I'll—!"" She told me—what else could she do. [SNIPPET] I think I even wept a little, like a child, but Sir John said something to the nurse, who began to reason with me firmly, and then they were gone, and somehow I was asleep. When I awoke again, my head was fairly clear, but there was an abominable reek of ether all about me. The moment I opened my eyes, I felt that something had happened. I asked for Sir John and for Alice. I saw a swift, curious look that I could not interpret come over the face of the nurse, then she was calm again, her countenance impassive."
2350,"""Lyddy's aware of you,"" he told the shadows. "" She has no idea of what you are, of course. But she knows you're around, kqyres. She's half seen you and it's beginning to bother her. It's beginning to bother me, too."" Part of the shifting grayness flowed over the board. [SNIPPET] At the end of half a year, Schiemann said no, he positively wouldn't do it. Len said ""Good-by."" Schiemann said, ""All right, but you'll be sorry; we'll all be sorry,"" and gave in. So they took the Valkyrie, the two of them—and Balas, of course, but naturally nobody would consult a madman—and headed for hyperspace. Len knew exactly where to go, even though he had no charts. The breakthrough he wanted was in their own sector and it had been carefully marked for him in his mind."
2351,"The Wizard’s advice was good, so again they started in the direction of the low mountain on the crest of which the wicker castle had been built. They had been gradually advancing uphill, so now the elevation seemed to them more like a round knoll than a mountaintop. However, the sides of the knoll were sloping and covered with green grass, so there was a stiff climb before them yet.  Undaunted, they plodded on and had almost reached the knoll when they suddenly observed that it was surrounded by a circle of flame. At first, the flames barely rose above the ground, but presently they grew higher and higher until a circle of flaming tongues of fire taller than any of their heads quite surrounded the hill on which the wicker castle stood. When they approached the flames, the heat was so intense that it drove them back again.  “This will never do for me!” [SNIPPET] I have seen many queer creatures in the Land of Oz, but none more queer than this giant frog who dresses like a man and walks on his hind legs. Come here, Wiljon,” she called to her husband, who was eating his breakfast, “and take a look at this astonishing freak.”  Wiljon the Winkie came to the door and looked out. He was still standing in the doorway when the Frogman approached and said with a haughty croak, “Tell me, my good man, have you seen a diamond-studded gold dishpan?”"
2352,"The road? He slogged through the mud, instantly soaking as soon as he was out of shelter, not knowing or caring. Through the front yard, out to the road. He could see the lights of the truck coming from far away, two tiny points in the darkness. But no twins. He waited helplessly while the truck rushed past, its headlights cutting holes in the darkness—fearing those lights would outline something that he had not seen. [SNIPPET] He awoke and only the rain was true. The tiny rain had increased to a wind-driven downpour and he was soaked where it had blown under the eaves onto the porch. From inside the house he heard a cry. She was sitting upright in bed."
2353,"We were humans. Since he was a ""tame"" Venusian, he knew quite a lot about humans. We had landed right in the middle of the huge cleared space that his tribe used as a dancing ground. This in itself was sufficient reason for him to destroy us utterly. [SNIPPET] You could have heard Shad Brisbee scream for miles around. The idea appalled him, because it was a direct challenge, and it also appealed to him because he was absolutely certain that he, or any other Venusian could out-dance any human who had ever put foot on the Veiled Planet. "" I'll do it!"" Shad Brisbee roared. """
2354,"Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her face. [SNIPPET] “I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married to him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption? It is my own act.”  “Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”"
2355,"They had a lacelike quality: tall buildings linked by lines of flickering incandescence. Something like a Roman candle shot skyward in the distance. ""Okay!"" he said. "" [SNIPPET] ""The people who brought you here were tax collectors we Rojac recruited from a subject planet. They were conditioned to make it impossible for them to leave their job untended. Unfortunately, they were clever enough to realize that if they brought someone else in who could do their job, they were released from their mental bonds. Very clever."" ""But—"" ""You may have their job,"" said the man. "" Normally, you would be put to work in the lower echelons, but we believe in meting out justice wherever possible."
2356,"It was only because he had inherited a considerable amount of money that he could do any research whatsoever.” “Hm-m-m. I seem to remember a paper about wave propagation in one of the quarterlies. Quite unorthodox, as I recall,” said Max. “Could be. But anyway, about Busch. “Busch majored in psychology at college, but took special courses after he graduated and took a Master’s in English. He has written two novels and three collections of poems under various pen names. [SNIPPET] It remains partially unaffected because it is closest to the ‘gravetostatic field center’, which I guess is the Earth’s center of attraction. This plane of ‘semi-treated’ atoms can be forced through an object, if it is moved horizontally, but its ‘untreated’ aspect prevents the subject wearing the device from falling through the floor. “Busch demonstrated this device to me, turning it on and strolling through various objects in this room. Think of it! No soldier could be killed or held prisoner. And—” “Now hang on,” objected Max. “"
2357,"The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only about a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. [SNIPPET] The scenery, judged by any ordinary esthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age—since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town's and the world's welfare at heart—people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps one reason—though it can not apply to uninformed strangers—is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence is wofully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace."
2358,"Slowly, the picture turned once more, and once again, relative to the usual directions of up and down, the picture was stubbornly, completely inverted. ""It's onto that, too,"" the repairman said, gloomily. He sat down on the floor, and assumed a kind of Yoga posture, peering between his legs. "" You could try it this way, Pops."" ""I'm pretty stiff,"" Mr. Rapp told him, shaking his head. ""Yeah,"" the repairman said, reinverting himself. For a long while he sat, pulling his beard thoughtfully, a look of deep thought on his face. [SNIPPET] ""I don't want to put you down, Pops,"" he said, grunting. "" Only, I got to see this. Over she goes."" He set it down again, right side up."
2359,"Only that you radio incorrect coordinates back to your base. Say you have moved on, that this is a barren world."" ""Let me talk to you first,"" he said. "" I want to...."" ""Please,"" Juba begged, moving toward him. "" It is no loss to you. Only a small favor, to protect our planet from outsiders, in return for ... for whatever pleasures I can provide for you, or my sisters, if I do not please you."" [SNIPPET] That's the riddle of the sphinx."" That is not the riddle of the sphinx, but Juba did not correct him. ""When you're attacked,"" he went on, ""you fight back."" ""It could not possibly,"" Juba said, ""be as simple as you make it sound."" ""Of course, it isn't,"" he said, and he took two square sheets that looked like papyrus, and put them each in a bowl. "" There is the question of what you did, or did not do, that you should be attacked."" ""And what did you do, or not do, that you should be attacked?"""
2360,"has become exceedingly rare because this crazy superstructure of SCIENCE, and even more so ADVENTURE, has become such a fetish that sound writing concerning people is rarely to be found. In pulp science-fiction, never. And the frightful smugness fostered by the modern s.f. magazines is simply appalling. It seems that not only the readers, but the editors and writers as well, cannot or will not see anything beyond their own perverted models. Just as one example which I remember very well, look how BRAVE NEW WORLD, the admirable and really important novel by Huxley, was received a few years ago. It was Clark Ashton Smith, I believe, who mentioned it as embodying some of Huxley's ""habitual pornography""—simply, stunning P. Schyler Miller; whom, I might mention, I consider as one of the most intellectual authors and fans. [SNIPPET] Charlie Hornig: The dark horse who says neigh to every manuscript I write for him. Dark-haired, dark-eyed, dark-skinned fiend who deals from the bottom of the manuscript pile over at Science-fiction. He has just learned to speak English during the past week and now he finds it much more fun picking out the manuscripts instead of leaping into a pile of them and bobbing up with one between his teeth. Makes lousy speeches. Is a human dynamo and expert guide to anyone in Manhattan."
2361,"We may be constitutionally insulated."" ""And you think the fire-ball broke down that insulation by the shock to Tristan's system?"" I asked. The logic of the thing was shaping up hazily, but unmistakably. "" But, then, why don't we frequently see people kiting off the earth as the result of explosions?"" ""How do you know they haven't? Don't we have plenty of mysterious disappearances as the result of explosions, and particularly, strangely large numbers of missing in a major war?"" [SNIPPET] ""If I don't,"" said Tristan distinctly, ""I'll have not the slightest need for the money."" But the airplane idea was out; we could think of no way for him to make the landing on such a swiftly-moving vehicle. Again Alice solved it. ""If you absolutely must break my heart and put me in a sanitarium,"" she sobbed, ""get a blimp!"" Of course! And that is what we did—on the first attempt coming unpleasantly close to doing just that to Alice."
2362,"And, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living. ""Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!"" he said, and he made a joke. "" What are you doing here?"" [SNIPPET] said the orderly. ""Is that a crime?"" said the painter. The orderly shrugged. "" If you don't like it here, Grandpa—"" he said, and he finished the thought with the trick telephone number that people who didn't want to live any more were supposed to call."
2363,"cried Miss Mercy, holding up her hands with the most winning giggle in the world, ‘what a mercenary girl you are! oh you naughty, thoughtful, prudent thing!’  It was perfectly charming, and worthy of the Pastoral age, to see how the two Miss Pecksniffs slapped each other after this, and then subsided into an embrace expressive of their different dispositions.  ‘He is well looking,’ said Mr Pecksniff, slowly and distinctly; ‘well looking enough. I do not positively expect any immediate premium with him.’ [SNIPPET] ‘Go on,’ said the other, smiling as if he knew what stuck in Martin’s throat.  ‘Especially,’ pursued Martin, ‘as I can already understand that it may have required great courage, even in his time, to write freely on any question which was not a party one in this very free country.’  ‘Some courage, no doubt,’ returned his new friend. ‘ Do you think it would require any to do so, now?’  ‘Indeed I think it would; and not a little,’ said Martin."
2364,"Travis' eye gleamed. "" Think of it, boys! He'll have to mount a frontal attack, against protected American riflemen. Ord, couldn't your Englishers tell him a few things about that!"" [SNIPPET] But we Americans have never broken a treaty with the Indians, and pray God we never shall. We aren't like the Mexicans, always pushing, always grabbing off New Mexico, Arizona, California. We aren't colonial oppressors, thank God! No, it wouldn't have worked out, even if we American immigrants had secured our rights in Texas—"" He lifted a short, heavy, percussion pistol in his hand and cocked it. "" I hate to say it, but perhaps if we hadn't taken Payne and Jefferson so seriously—if we could only have paid lip service, and done what we really wanted to do, in our hearts ... no matter."
2365,"Where are you going, Peggy?"" cried Lotless, the first to turn fearful.  ""To throw some things into my trunk,"" she responded airily. "" Will you come with me, Mary?"" [SNIPPET] asked Barbara, innocently.  ""No, the vigilance committee.""  In this way Monty routed the enemy and cleared the field before the end of another week. Grimes transferred his objectionable affection and Barbara was not even asked to be wife number three. Brewster's campaign was so ardent that he neglected other duties deplorably, falling far behind his improvident average."
2366,"The tall soldier was swearing in a loud voice. From his lips came a black procession of curious oaths. Of a sudden another broke out in a querulous way like a man who has mislaid his hat. “ Well, why don’t they support us? Why don’t they send supports? [SNIPPET] Each felt satisfied with the other’s possession of it, but each felt bound to declare, by an offer to carry the emblem, his willingness to further risk himself. The youth roughly pushed his friend away.  The regiment fell back to the stolid trees. There it halted for a moment to blaze at some dark forms that had begun to steal upon its track."
2367,"And then, nothing,"" he repeated incredulously. "" Nothing."" The phone was one long ring now, taken off of automatic signal and rung with a hand key pressed down and held there. In a daze, Jennings picked up the phone. ""Yes, General,"" he answered as though he were no more than a robot. He hardly listened to the general's questions, did not need the report that every radarscope throughout the area had lost contact at the same instant. Somehow he had known that would be true, that it wasn't just his own mechanisms failing. [SNIPPET] Seven minutes, Jennings thought, and here I am trying to explain the culmination of the entire science of all mankind to a lardbrain in simple kindergarten words. Well, he'd wished there was something to break the tension of the last half hour, keep him occupied. He had it. ""You mean the army wouldn't know, after the ship got up, whether it was ours or the enemy's?"" the senator asked incredulously. ""There are meteors in space, Senator,"" Jennings said carefully. """
2368,"""Sure, come in,"" Solomon replied. The questions were odd: Do you have explosives here? Can you weld metal tanks? What is your education? Were you ever an engineer? What were you doing last night? [SNIPPET] If you'd been able to see it all, you'd have worried. The full circle of radar and communications crews around Fullerton had acted as though the whole town were going to pussyfoot away at sundown. Nine was hidden in a curious farmer's orange grove. Seven was tucked between station wagons in the back row of a used car lot. Four was assigned the loading dock of a meat-packing plant, but the night watchman wouldn't allow them to stay."
2369,"Nothing but scandals from one end of the week to the other. Everyone hating and making fun of you. You've finished my patience. This ends it.""  ""Dirty linen,"" he rumbled.  ""It's not a secret,"" she cried. "" Do you suppose that the whole street—the whole of London, for that matter—— Get away, Austin, we don't want you here. [SNIPPET] ""Then I must confess that I don't know what it is.""  ""You need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance, for I don't suppose the whole South Kensington staff could give a name to it."" He took a little bone the size of a bean out of a pill-box. "" So far as I am a judge this human bone is the analogue of the one which you hold in your hand."
2370,"All the tractors were in good radio contact; Zaino made sure of that before he abandoned the radio watch to Rowson, suited up and joined Hargedon at the remaining one. They climbed in, and Hargedon set it in motion. At about the same time, the first tractor came into view again, now traveling north on the farther side of the chasm. Hargedon took this as evidence that the route thus far was unchanged, and kicked in highest speed. [SNIPPET] I'll have a really precise check in an hour, but I can tell right now that you have about one and a half metric tons to split up among the three of you. ""Ideal departure time is three hundred ten hours away, as you all know. We can stay here until then, or go into a parking-and-survey orbit at almost any time before then. You have all the survey you need, I should think, from the other time. But suit yourselves."" ""I'd just as soon be space-sick as seasick,"" remarked Camille Burkett. "" I still hate to think that the entire planet is as shivery as the spot we picked."""
2371,"Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had paused at Grampa's feet. Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. [SNIPPET] Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring intently at Fweep. "" What you doing, Four?"" ""Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,"" Four said absently. """
2372,"When they had delivered their message, the king bade them withdraw while he consulted with his knights and barons what reply to send. Then some of the younger knights would have slain the ambassadors, saying that their speech was a rebuke to all who heard the king insulted by it. But when King Arthur heard that, he ordered none to touch them upon pain of death; and sending officers, he had them taken to a noble lodging, and there entertained with the best cheer. “ And,” said he, “let no dainty be spared, for the Romans are great lords; and though their message please me not, yet must I remember mine honour.” [SNIPPET] Most noble king,” she answered, “my lord, Sir Gareth, is my first love and shall be my last, and if I may not have him for my husband I will have none.” Then said the king to them, “Be well assured that for my crown I would not be the cause of parting your two hearts.”  Then was high preparation made for the marriage, for the king desired it should be at the Michaelmas next following, at Kinkenadon-by-the-Sea.  So Sir Gareth sent out messages to all the knights whom he had overcome in battle that they should be there upon his marriage-day.  Therefore, at the next Michaelmas, came a goodly company to Kinkenadon-by-the-Sea. And there did the Archbishop of Canterbury marry Sir Gareth and the Lady Lyones with all solemnity."
2373,"""I have,"" Juba said, ""some idea."" She hadn't known they talked about it. She thought they just did it. ""Well, you're wrong."" ""Oh,"" she said, and stood up and walked over to the brook so he would not see her face. For she wondered wherein she was lacking and she was embarrassed. "" Then,"" she asked, ""what do you want of me?"" [SNIPPET] And that is a holy thing, and an honor to one's house, if it is chosen from the heart. But if it is chosen from fear of crossing the passageways of life—then it is no honor but a shame. And Juba knew she could not bear such a shame, either for her house or within the depths of her soul. ""Mother Juno,"" she prayed, ""make clear the vision of my soul, and let me not, in my vanity, think I find good what the goddesses see to be evil."" So she rose with a strong and grateful heart, as though she had already faced her trial and had been equal to it."
2374,"And the old washerwoman popped her head in at the door, nodded to him friendly, and said, “Thanks, many thanks, my good child, for your help! May the good ever-loving God fulfil your loveliest dream!”  Little Tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed, but the loving God knew it. [SNIPPET] “Do you choose to be quiet?” said the robber maiden. “ If you don't, I shall make you.”  In the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood-pigeons had said; and the little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her head, and said, “That's no matter—that's no matter. Do you know where Lapland lies!” she asked of the Reindeer.  “Who should know better than I?”"
2375,"Alas! as I grew older, and obtained some works treating of my favorite study, I found that I was only on the threshold of a science to the investigation of which some of the greatest men of the age were devoting their lives and intellects. As I grew up, my parents, who saw but little likelihood of anything practical resulting from the examination of bits of moss and drops of water through a brass tube and a piece of glass, were anxious that I should choose a profession. It was their desire that I should enter the counting-house of my uncle, Ethan Blake, a prosperous merchant, who carried on business in New York. This suggestion I decisively combated. I had no taste for trade; I should only make a failure; in short, I refused to become a merchant. But it was necessary for me to select some pursuit. [SNIPPET] The Eye of M There was a light in Simon's room as I entered my house. A vague impulse urged me to visit him. As I opened the door of his sitting-room unannounced, he was bending, with his back toward me, over a carcel lamp, apparently engaged in minutely examining some object which he held in his hands. As I entered, he started suddenly, thrust his hand into his breast pocket, and turned to me with a face crimson with confusion."
2376,"""Look! Look! A natatorium!"" Beverly shrieked. "" I know I wanted a nice big place to swim in, besides my backyard pool and the ocean, but I didn't tell anybody to build that—I swear I didn't!"" ""You didn't have to, pet."" Poynter put his arm around her curvaceous waist and squeezed. "" [SNIPPET] Then: ""Here's the source of radiation, sir,"" a searchman reported. "" It's a point source, though, not an object at this range."" ""And here's the artifact, sir,"" Pilot Snowden said. "" We're coming up on it fast."

2378,"When a whole people panic then an object for their hate must be found. A naming. An immediate object. He remembered the newspaper story that began: ""They lynched twelve men, twelve ex-men, in New Mexico last night ..."" Have I been wrong? [SNIPPET] ""She will die,"" the voice said; one voice for two. "" This part of her will die."" And then her voice came—as it had been once before when all of the world was young.

2379,"So now I have played the play, and told thee of thee; tell me now of me, and play thy play.  For a while stood Birdalone silent, blushing and confused, but whiles casting shy glances at her own body, what she might see of it. At last she spake: Fair friend, I would do thy will, but I am not deft of speech; for I speak but little, save with the fowl and wild things, and they may not learn me the speech of man. Yet I will say that I wonder to hear thee call me fair and beauteous; for my dame tells me that never, nor sayeth aught of my aspect save in her anger, and then it is: Rag! and bag-of-bones! [SNIPPET] Said Atra: Maybe it were well to let the fetters abide on her ankles, lest the mistress should come; but for the wrists, reach out thine hands, wayfarer. So did Birdalone, and Atra laid her things on the ground, and unlocked the hand-shackles, and did them off: and meanwhile Viridis spread forth the banquet, partly on the floor, and partly on that ill-omened coffer. Then she went up to Birdalone and kissed her, and said: Now shalt thou sit in our lady’s throne, and we shall serve thee, and thou shalt deem thee a great one.  Nought else would they have, and Birdalone laid her nakedness on the purple cushions, and then they fell all three to the feast. The victual was both plenteous and dainty, of venison and fowl, and cream and fruits and sweetmeats, and good wine they had withal: never had Birdalone feasted in like manner, and the heart came back unto her, and her cheeks grew rosy and her eyes glittered. But she said: How if your lady were to come upon us here, and we so merry? Said Atra: Out of the chair must thou when thou hearest the key in the lock, and then is all well, and she would have nought against us; for she herself bade us, and me in special, to keep thee company here, and talk with thee; and Aurea also would have been here, but that she is serving the lady as now."
2380,"said Dr. Hitz. ""I wish people wouldn't call it 'the Catbox,' and things like that,"" she said. "" It gives people the wrong impression."" ""You're absolutely right,"" said Dr. Hitz. "" [SNIPPET] ""Triplets!"" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of triplets. The law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of the child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if they were all to live, called for three volunteers. ""Do the parents have three volunteers?"" said Leora Duncan."
2381,"Nobody wires me up to anything I can't understand, and that machine is too deep for me."" Margaret elected to follow Crane's example, and, impressed by the need for haste evident in the slave's bearing, the four walked up to the machine without further talk. The electrodes were clamped into place quickly and the slave pressed a lever. Instantly the four visitors felt that they had a complete understanding of the languages and customs of both Mardonale, the nation in which they now were, and of Kondal, to which nation the slaves belonged, the only two civilized nations upon Osnome. While the look of amazement at this method of receiving instruction was still upon their faces, the slave—or rather, as they now knew him, Dunark, the Kofedix or Crown Prince of the great nation of Kondal—began to disconnect the wires. He cut out the wires leading to the two girls and to Crane, and was reaching for Seaton's, when there was a blinding flash, a crackling sound, the heavy smoke of burning metal and insulation, and both Dunark and Seaton fell to the floor. [SNIPPET] Here's all I know about it,"" and in a few words he related the foregoing incident. Scott's face showed in turn interest, amazement, and pitying alarm. He took Seaton by the arm. ""Dick, old top, I never knew you to drink or dope, but this stuff sure came out of either a bottle or a needle. Did you see a pink serpent carrying it away?"
2382,"The radioman merely nodded affirmatively; his attention was already back at his job. Burkett was speaking a good deal faster than before. ""Never mind if the sample isn't lashed tight yet—if it falls off there'll be plenty more. There isn't time! Arnie, get in touch with Dr. Mardikian and Dr. Marini. Tell them that this volcano is explosive, that all estimates of what the flow may do are off until we can make more measures, and in any case the whole situation is unpredictable. Everyone should get back as soon as possible. [SNIPPET] The pillar of sable ash was rising straighter, as though the wind were having less effect on it. An equally black cone had risen into sight beyond Northeast Spur—a cone that must have grown to some two thousand feet in roughly ten hours. It had far steeper sides than the cinder mounds near it; it couldn't be made of the same loose ash. Perhaps it consisted of half-melted particles which were fusing together as they fell—that might be what Burkett had meant by ""spatter-cone."""
2383,"Lightning this time?"" He nodded. The rockets of the Monitor II roared; its prow dipped forward, and at an incredible speed it swept down on the line of Lassan warships, followed by the rest of the American fleet. But it was no surprise this time. [SNIPPET] Pick whoever you want for an assistant and try it out. Any more ideas?"" ""What day is it?"" asked Ola Mae Roberts."
2384,"Well it all started on their colorvision program, the one where they select the All American babies. You've seen it haven't you?"" Turner shook his head. ""Sputtering sputniks! I know you're all wrapped up in your work but it doesn't have to be a shroud. You'd better get out into the world a little."" The Director laid a friendly arm on George's shoulder. "" [SNIPPET] ""Well now, Gloria, the dessert!"" George was saying. "" What'll it be, crepes suzette?"" She smiled across the table. """
2385,"“The marines are on their way,” hissed Stetson. “ We’re coming in to get you. I’m going to want to know how you guessed that one.” “You are a weak fool like the others,” gritted Tanub. “It’s too bad you formed your opinion of us by observing only the low grades of the R&R,” said Orne. “Easy, boy,” hissed Stetson. “ Don’t pick a fight with him now. [SNIPPET] The red light above the speaker grid began blinking. Stetson shot an angry glance at it. “ Yeah, Hal?” “O.K., Stet. Orders just came through. We use Plan C. ComGO says to brief the field man, and jet out of here.”"
2386,"It was supposed to make Planeteer cadets and junior officers feel properly humble, but it didn't work. By tradition, the Planeteers were the cockiest gang that ever blasted through high vacuum. Major Barris shook his head sadly. "" You admit you're a simp, Foster. The rest of you are simps, too, but you don't believe it. [SNIPPET] What I want to ask, sir, is when do we let go the bombs? I do not know much about radiation, but I can set those bombs like you want them."" Rip was touched by the Planeteer's faith in his ability to solve the radiation problem. That was why being an officer in the Special Order Squadrons was so challenging. The men knew the kind of training their officers had, and they expected them to come up with technical solutions as the situation required. ""You'll have a chance to set the bombs in just a short while,"" he said crisply. "" Let's get busy."
2387,"What was the meaning of Sitsumi's cryptic utterance? ""Bring them in,"" snapped Sitsumi. Jeter studied the man with interest. He knew instantly who he was and understood why Sitsumi had refused to answer his radio messages to Japan. [SNIPPET] At that moment nothing was happening in New York City—nothing new, that is."" Hadley paused again. ""Go on, man!"" said Jeter hoarsely. ""Twenty minutes later the Hueber was lowered back into the water, practically unharmed. It had all happened so swiftly that the sailors aboard scarcely realized anything had happened."
2388,"They'll probably examine your blood tomorrow. If they found the specific antibody, or even a general antisperm antibody, that would really get us into trouble for fraud."" He shook his head. "" No. I'm afraid that's not the answer. I don't know what to do."" [SNIPPET] Your suit is five years out of style."" Abashed, George looked at himself. "" What's wrong with it?"" ""You'd never understand and I haven't time to tell you. What I want to know is, who gave you the right to use my name in this silly Mother America contest. And you,"" she turned on the Dee Lish agent, ""quit gawping at me. I'm not going to blast off."
2389,"My Dad told me even before we came here—"" ""That's not the secret. Fine secret! Ever see a circus?"" [SNIPPET] Come on, let's go up to the loft."" They clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them. Slim pointed and said, ""There's sort of a hole in the canvas."" Red frowned. "" How'd that get there?"" He lifted the canvas, looked in, and said, with relief, ""They're still there."" ""The canvas appeared to be burned,"" worried Slim."
2390,"""Now that's not right,"" Grampa objected. "" I said tonic and I mean tonic. Got a little alcohol in it for a preservative, maybe, but the important part is the minerals. That's the Longevity Institute's secret. It's what keeps me young. [SNIPPET] ""Fweep?"" queried the raspberry lips. "" Fweep?"" ""If it's Four's friend,"" Reba said firmly, ""it can stay. If you don't like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room."" Joyce stood up indignantly. "" Well!"
2391,"They ranged from Ceres, a tiny world only 480 miles in diameter, down to chunks of rock the size of a house. No accurate count of asteroids—or minor planets, as they were called—had been made, but the observatory on Mars had charted the orbits of thousands. A few were more than a mile in diameter, but most were great boulders of irregular shape, from a few feet to several hundred feet at their greatest dimension. ""I know the usual stuff about them,"" he told O'Brine. "" [SNIPPET] Rip murmured ""Brennschluss,"" and the murmur was like a trumpet blast. The Scorpius had reached velocity, and the nuclear drive had cut out. From terrific acceleration, they had dropped to zero. The ship was making high speed, but velocity cannot be felt. For the moment the men were weightless."
2392,"""Hm, this is one orbit I haven't travelled."" She smiled and nodded her approval. "" Set me a course, Navigator."" They moved towards the door together. ""Doctor! The program tonight ... have you forgotten?"" George looked back and waved airily. "" [SNIPPET] ""You'd never understand and I haven't time to tell you. What I want to know is, who gave you the right to use my name in this silly Mother America contest. And you,"" she turned on the Dee Lish agent, ""quit gawping at me. I'm not going to blast off. Who are you anyway?"" ""Miss Manson, please!"" The little man was in front of her again. """
2393,"He looked up at her, his eyes frightened. "" Do you have any idea of what Lazar will do to me once he gets his fat hands around my throat? He won't kill me right away."" ""Why come to me?"" ""You can help me."" ""What can I do?"" [SNIPPET] ""Brickel?"" he said, coming up to her. His white coveralls were spotted with grime. There was a dark bruise on his right cheek."
2394,"They know that we, as escaped captives, would be without harness or trappings, and are meeting us in the same state."" Seaton brought the vessel to the dock near the little group, and the Earthly visitors remained inside their vessel while the rulers of Kondal welcomed the sons and daughters they had given up for dead. After the affecting reunion, which was very similar to an earthly one under similar circumstances, the Kofedix led his father up to the Skylark and his guests stepped down upon the dock. ""Friends,"" Dunark began, ""I have told you of my father, Roban, the Karfedix of Kondal. Father, it is a great honor to present to you those who rescued us from Mardonale—Seaton, Karfedix of Knowledge; Crane, Karfedix of Wealth; Miss Vaneman; and Miss Spencer. [SNIPPET] When it had come to rest Crane read his watch and made a rapid calculation. ""About three hundred and fifty million miles,"" he stated. "" Clear out of our solar system already, and from the distance covered he must have had a constant acceleration so as to approximate the velocity of light, and he is still going with full...."" ""But nothing can possibly go that fast, Mart, it's impossible. How about Einstein's theory?"" ""That is a theory, this measurement of distance is a fact, as you know from our tests."" ""That's right."
2395,"The CIA man gestured impatiently. "" War games simulations aren't new. You've been doing them for years."" ""Yes, but this machine is different,"" Ford pointed out. "" It not only gives a much more detailed war game. It's the next logical step in the development of machine-simulated war games."" He hesitated dramatically. [SNIPPET] Knowledge died. Civilization was completely gone from the planet Earth. The helmet was lifted slowly off his head. The CIA man found that he was too weak to raise his arms and help. He was shivering and damp with perspiration. ""Now you see,"" Ford said quietly, ""why the military men cracked up when they used the computer."""
2396,"The high priest is also the chief executive (as well as the minister of education and head of the medical faculty), and he rules jointly with a priestess who also officiates as chief judge. The Agskians have some strange ideas to a terrestrial eye—for example, suicide is an honor, and anyone of insufficient rank who commits it condemns his immediate family to punishment for his presumption. They are great family people, in general. Also, they never lie, and find it hard to realize that other beings do. Murder, to them, is merely a matter for negotiation between the murderer and the relatives of the victim, provided it is open and without deceit. But grand larceny, since property is the foundation of the family, is punished in a way that shows that the Agskians, though technologically primitive, are psychologically very advanced. They reason that death, because it comes inevitably to all, is the least of misfortunes. [SNIPPET] He had never even loved a house which could be razed. He could not be said to have loved the immense fortune he had stolen, for he had concealed his wealth and used little of it, and in any event it had all been confiscated and, so far as possible, restored proportionately to those he had robbed. What he had loved most, doubtless, was his prowess in stealing unimaginable sums and getting away with it—but there is no way of ""killing"" a criminal technique. lmost a year had passed. Agsk was beginning to wish The Eel had never been caught, or that they had never been awarded the glory of trying him."
2397,"So he was much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him but he would stay and endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave another very happy turn to all this. I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after some account given them of what I had done for them, viz. what necessary things I had provided for them, and how they were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and very thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had taken of it; and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I first asked them if they were married men or bachelors? They soon explained their condition to me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and the other three were single men, or bachelors. I asked them with what conscience they could take these women, and call them their wives, and have so many children by them, and not be lawfully married to them? They all gave me the answer I expected, viz. [SNIPPET] What you call dat? W.A.—He is our Father and Maker, and He pities and spares us. Wife.—So then He never makee kill, never angry when you do wicked; then He no good Himself, or no great able. W.A.—Yes, yes, my dear, He is infinitely good and infinitely great, and able to punish too; and sometimes, to show His justice and vengeance, He lets fly His anger to destroy sinners and make examples; many are cut off in their sins."
2398,"We unfastened him and pulled him to the ground, where I sat on his knees while she pressed down on his shoulders, and so kept him recumbent, both horrified at the insistent lift of his body under us. She kissed him frantically and stroked his cheeks, I feeling utterly without resource. He grew stronger, muttered wildly, and his eyes opened, staring upward through the tree limbs. He became silent, and stiffened, gazing fixedly upward with a horror in his wild blue gaze which chilled our blood. What did he see there—what dire other-world thing dragging him into the depths of space? Shortly his eyes closed, and he ceased to mutter. I took his legs under my arms—the storm was clearing now—and we set out for home with gruesomely buoyant steps, the insistent pull remaining steady. [SNIPPET] He had waited too long before using his elevator; and the chute fled hopelessly away just ahead of the uptilted nose of the blimp. I could only moan, and Alice made no sound or movement. Next we saw the blimp's water ballast streaming earthward in the sun, and it was put into a long, steady spiral in pursuit of the parachute, whose speed—or so it seemed to my agonized gaze—was now noticeably on the increase. The altitude seemed appallingly great; the blimp's ceiling, I knew, was only about twenty thousand; and my brother, even if not frozen to death by that time, would be traveling far faster then than any climbing speed the blimp could make; as his fall increased in speed, the climb of the bag decreased."
2399,"Therefore, in the might of Heaven, I will sit down and write: I will let the wicked of this world know what I have done in the faith of the promises, and justification by grace, that they may read and tremble, and bless their gods of silver and gold that the minister of Heaven was removed from their sphere before their blood was mingled with their sacrifices.  I was born an outcast in the world, in which I was destined to act so conspicuous a part. My mother was a burning and a shining light, in the community of Scottish worthies, and in the days of her virginity had suffered much in the persecution of the saints. But it so pleased Heaven that, as a trial of her faith, she was married to one of the wicked; a man all over spotted with the leprosy of sin. As well might they have conjoined fire and water together, in hopes that they would consort and amalgamate, as purity and corruption: She fled from his embraces the first night after their marriage, and from that time forth his iniquities so galled her upright heart that she quitted his society altogether, keeping her own apartments in the same house with him.  I was the second son of this unhappy marriage, and, ere ever I was born, my father according to the flesh disclaimed all relation or connection with me, and all interest in me, save what the law compelled him to take, which was to grant me a scanty maintenance; and had it not been for a faithful minister of the gospel, my mother's early instructor, I should have remained an outcast from the church visible. [SNIPPET] No opposition could for a moment cause him either to blush, or retract one item that he had advanced. Therefore the Duke of Argyle and his friends made such use of him as sportsmen often do of terriers, to start the game, and make a great yelping noise to let them know whither the chase is proceeding. They often did this out of sport, in order to tease their opponent; for of all pesterers that ever fastened on man he was the most insufferable: knowing that his coat protected him from manual chastisement, he spared no acrimony, and delighted in the chagrin and anger of those with whom he contended. But he was sometimes likewise of real use to the heads of the Presbyterian faction, and therefore was admitted to their tables, and of course conceived himself a very great man.  His ward accompanied him; and, very shortly after their arrival in Edinburgh, Robert, for the first time, met with the young laird his brother, in a match at tennis. The prowess and agility of the young squire drew forth the loudest plaudits of approval from his associates, and his own exertion alone carried the game every time on the one side, and that so far as all I along to count three for their one. The hero's name soon ran round the circle, and when his brother Robert, who was an onlooker, learned who it was that was gaining so much applause, he came and stood close beside him all the time that the game lasted, always now and then putting in a cutting remark by way of mockery."
2400,"We seem to be out of eggs, too. And bacon. And I thought we had half a pound left of that cheese, but that's gone too."" ""Good Lord, Norah, if you've got that much marketing to do, can't you do it yourself?"" ""Sure, if you leave the car. I'm not going to walk all that way and back."" [SNIPPET] It would just be a nuisance if they hadn't taken SK540. Now they've got to find him, or do about five years' work over again, without any assurance of as great a success. To say nothing of letting our super-rat loose on the world."" ""What on earth could even a super-rat do that would matter—to human beings, I mean?"" ""Nobody knows. Maybe that's what we're going to find out."""
2401,"The tall soldier held out his gory hand. There was a curious red and black combination of new blood and old blood upon it. “ Where yeh been, Henry?” he asked. He continued in a monotonous voice, “I thought mebbe yeh got keeled over. There been thunder t’ pay t’-day. I was worryin’ about it a good deal.” [SNIPPET] As he who had so befriended him was thus passing out of his life, it suddenly occurred to the youth that he had not once seen his face.    The youth went slowly toward the fire indicated by his departed friend. As he reeled, he bethought him of the welcome his comrades would give him."
2402,"A dozen men in UN battledress came up and took them prisoner. Benson shouted to them, and then rose and came down to join them. They were British—Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, advertising the fact by inconspicuous bits of tartan on their uniforms. The subaltern in command looked at him and nodded. [SNIPPET] The Psychological Department was never too busy to refuse another case; they hunted patients gleefully, each psych-shark seeking in every one proof of his own particular theories. It was with relief that he watched them fill out the red tag which gave him a priority on jet transports for home. Ankara to Alexandria, Alexandria to Dakar, Dakar to Belém, Belém to the shattered skyline of New York, the ""hurry-and-wait"" procedures at Fort Carlisle, and, after the usual separation promotion, Major Fred Benson, late of Benson's Butchers, was back at teaching high school juniors the difference between H2O and H2SO4. There were two high schools in the city: McKinley High, on the east side, and Dwight Eisenhower High, on the west."
2403,"Tiflin sneered genially. "" Some cops can't carry badges. And they don't always stop trouble, but they try... Anyhow, what side do you think I was on, after Fessler kicked me around for months...? Let Igor go. He's got law and order in his soul. [SNIPPET] Maybe in another bank—in another town. We could get the cash we need. Hell, though—be cavalier—it's just a thought."" ""You damned fool!"""
2404,"""Don't explain it to me,"" said the engineer mildly. "" I know what you meant. Suicide's the direct product of survival compulsions—drives that try to save something, just as fight and flight are efforts to save something. I don't think you need worry; immolation doesn't tempt me. I'm too—too interested in what goes on. [SNIPPET] ""Nonsense."" ""I can't stand things that scuttle and slither and crawl,"" said Ives. His voice was suddenly womanish. "" Don't let anything like that in here!"" From the quarters aft came a faint scratching, a squeak. Ives turned pale. His wattles quivered."
2405,"exclaimed Perkins. "" Then may I ask your name?"" ""Winifred Willowby."" ""Not the one who is reputed to own more United States bonds than any other man in America?"" [SNIPPET] Then he sat down. As far as the records are concerned, that was the longest speech the Old Man made in his life. The Boys hardly knew what to do; they felt they should applaud, but not being certain remained quiet. Then Willowby stood up. ""I do not want very much, gentlemen,"" he remarked. "" I only want to be the next President of the United States, and I can be, with your help."
2406,"Even so, I believe they thought me mad. But poor fools! I would think. They can hardly realize that I have all of eternity before me to study. I went to school for many decades. I would pass from University to University, leisurely gathering all the fruits of every subject I took up, revelling in study as no student revelled ever before. There was no need of hurry in my life, no fear of death too soon. [SNIPPET] But I have forgotten them. I began to emerge from the effect of the ether. Everything was dim, but I could perceive Alice beside me, and Sir John. ""Bravely done!"" Sir John was saying, and Alice, too, was saying something, but I cannot remember what. For a long while we talked, I speaking the nonsense of those who are coming out from under ether, they teasing me a little solemnly."
2407,"He was nudged forward—a large man, with a large beard at which he plucked nervously.  “Well, really, Warden,” he said, “we—we hardly know,” * and he ended with what can only be described as a giggle. He fell low in the esteem of his fellows.  Thinking of that past Sub-Warden whose fame was linked with the sun-dial, the Warden eyed this one keenly.  “Well, gentlemen,” he presently said, “our young men seem to be already at table. Shall we follow their example?” And he led the way up the steps. [SNIPPET] That she had bewitched him did but make it the more needful that he should shun all converse with her. It was imperative that he should banish her from his mind, quickly. He must not dilute his own soul’s essence. He must not surrender to any passion his dandihood."
2408,"He bent double and touched the floor with the palms of his hands. He jumped up and down with his legs stiff. He stopped suddenly with his right hand at rigid salute. But his eyes were still vacant through every posture. Barter’s face showed a glow of satisfaction. [SNIPPET] You don’t know of some special scheme that has been worked out to trap me?” “I know of no scheme. Now that I am in your hands, Professor, what do you intend doing with me?” Barter stared at Ellen for several minutes. 2 “I haven’t captured Bentley ... yet,” he said at last, slowly, “but I shall––no doubt about that. It is inevitable––as inevitable as Caleb Barter."
2409,"Why were not the S-Regions discovered long ago? NIEMAND. Because the radio exploration of the Sun only began since the end of World War II. LATHAM. How does it happen that you only got patients suffering from S-radiation since about 1955? NIEMAND. I think we did get such patients previously but not in large enough numbers to attract attention. [SNIPPET] What other properties of the S-Regions have you discovered? NIEMAND. Middletown says that the radio waves emanating from them are strongly circularly polarized. Moreover, the sense of rotation remains constant while one is passing across the Sun."
2410,"This, therefore, Merlin promised him on one condition—namely, that the king should give him up the first son born of the marriage. For Merlin by his arts foreknew that this firstborn should be the long-wished prince, King Arthur.  When Uther, therefore, was at length happily wedded, Merlin came to the castle on a certain day, and said, “Sir, thou must now provide thee for the nourishing of thy child.”  And the king, nothing doubting, said, “Be it as thou wilt.” [SNIPPET] Now do I defy thee!” cried the Red Knight to Sir Beaumains, and put his spear in rest and spurred his horse. Then both knights turned back a little space, and ran together with all their might, till their horses fell to the earth. Then, with their swords, they fought fiercely for the space of three hours. And at last, Sir Beaumains overcame his foe, and smote him to the ground."
2411,"You will come with those tearful eyes, those cheeks pale and ghastly, those hands lifted in supplication, as when you sought from me that mercy which I gave not! Then will my perdition be certain! Then will come your Mother’s Ghost, and hurl me down into the dwellings of Fiends, and flames, and Furies, and everlasting torments! And ’tis you, who will accuse me! ’ [SNIPPET] “No matter; Let me at least hear what She has to say. Do, my dear Aunt! Oblige me, I beseech you!”  “Well, well! Antonia, since you are so bent upon the thing, ... Here, good Woman, you shall see the hands of both of us."
2412,"Were you the geneticist for this boy?"" ""Yes, I was. I told you he was Gloria Manson's. Don't you remember when you met her?"" ""Soaring satellites!"" Harmon exclaimed. "" How could I forget? [SNIPPET] She put her arms around his neck and kissed him. The kiss lasted ... and lasted. Finally George broke it off. ""My God!"""
2413,"You'll be on the ship with me."" ""With you!"" The thought went all through Juba, as ice water does sometimes, and bubbled up into her ears. "" With you."" [SNIPPET] ""I...."" What was she afraid of? If he'd meant to do her any violence, he'd have done it already. And this would provide Juba's opportunity—""Yes,"" she said. "" I would be delighted."""
2414,"It was that for the second Sunday in Lent, and evidently well known to him. As I read it the words seemed to bear a new and deeper significance, and my heart repeated with fervour the petition for protection from those ""evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul."" I bade him good night and went away very sorrowful. Parnham, at John's request, had arranged to sleep on a sofa in his master's bedroom.  I rose betimes the next morning and inquired at my brother's room how he was. Parnham reported that he had passed a restless night, and on entering a little later I found him in a high fever, slightly delirious, and evidently not so well as when I saw him last. Mrs. Temple, with much kindness and forethought, had begged Dr. Empson to remain at Royston for the night, and he was soon in attendance on his patient. [SNIPPET] Yet I yearn to see Worth once more, and to feel again the west winds blowing in the evening across from Portland, and smell the thyme on the Dorset downs. In a few days I hope perhaps to be a little stronger, and I then wish to show you a discovery which I have made in Naples. After that you may order them to harness the horses, and carry me back to Worth Maltravers.""  I endeavoured to ascertain from Signor Baravelli, the doctor, something as to the actual state of his patient; but my knowledge of Italian was so slight that I could neither make him understand what I would be at, nor comprehend in turn what he replied, so that this attempt was relinquished. From my brother himself I gathered that he had begun to feel his health much impaired as far back as the early spring, but though his strength had since then gradually failed him, he had not been confined to the house until a month past. He spent the day and often the night reclining on his sofa and speaking little. He had apparently lost the taste for the violin which had once absorbed so much of his attention; indeed I think the bodily strength necessary for its performance had probably now failed him."
2415,"He said it just like those cowboys on the television."" Hanstark looked puzzled. "" Perhaps you had better tell me more about this. When did he first start acting this way?"" Mrs. Nest glanced up at the television set, then back at Hanstark. "" It was right after Texas Week. You remember—they showed all of those old cowboy pictures."" [SNIPPET] Hanstark took out a small pad and a short ball-point pen. He wrote something down before he spoke again. "" Is he violent? Did he get angry when you told him there was no cliff?"" Mrs. Nest was silent for a moment."
2416,"Wonder you don't use atomic power,"" he observed lightly. The beard nodded. "" We've been asked that. Matter of esthetics. [SNIPPET] How I loathe that man! But Larry's almost as bad, with his shame-faced bumptiousness, as if we'd all sneaked off on a joyride to Venus. And there's Jokichi at the opposite extreme, forever scared he won't distribute his affection equally, dividing it up into mean little packets like candy for jealous children who would scream if they got one chewy less. And then there's Sasha and Ernest—"" ""Who are you talking about?"""
2417,"But to-night, while he told Oover about her, he could see into her soul. Nor did he pity her. She had loved. She had known the one thing worth living for—and dying for. She, as she went down to the mill-pond, had felt just that ecstasy of self-sacrifice which he himself had felt to-day and would feel to-morrow. And for a while, too—for a full year—she had known the joy of being loved, had been for Greddon “the fairest witch that ever was or will be.” He could not agree with Oover’s long disquisition on her sufferings. [SNIPPET] “You don’t believe in the love that corrodes, the love that ruins?”  “No,” laughed Zuleika.  “You have never dipped into the Greek pastoral poets, nor sampled the Elizabethan sonneteers?”  “No, never. You will think me lamentably crude: my experience of life has been drawn from life itself.”  “Yet often you talk as though you had read rather much. Your way of speech has what is called ‘the literary flavour’.”"
2418,"Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air.  From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away from beneath; the sun ate from above. [SNIPPET] He never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs. Yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the life, received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition.  He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life. A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed him of his unfinished ration. There was no defending it."
2419,"He loitered in a fever of eagerness for the division commander to apply to him.  As he warily moved about, he heard the general call out irritably: “Tompkins, go over an’ see Taylor, an’ tell him not t’ be in such an all-fired hurry; tell him t’ halt his brigade in th’ edge of th’ woods; tell him t’ detach a reg’ment—say I think th’ center ’ll break if we don’t help it out some; tell him t’ hurry up.”  A slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught these swift words from the mouth of his superior. He made his horse bound into a gallop almost from a walk in his haste to go upon his mission. [SNIPPET] But he was amid wounds. The mob of men was bleeding. Because of the tattered soldier’s question he now felt that his shame could be viewed. He was continually casting sidelong glances to see if the men were contemplating the letters of guilt he felt burned into his brow.  At times he regarded the wounded soldiers in an envious way."
2420,"And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the forest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled flint-lock. [SNIPPET] They closed in upon her, snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath the bristling mass of bodies.  So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw François, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long."
2421,"He felt very tired and empty, the way he'd felt after Schiemann and Balas had died, as if nothing mattered any more. He didn't argue with her. ""What would you do if you left me, Lyddy?"" he asked gently. ""I can always—"" she swallowed—""go back to my old job, I guess."" Alard gave an exclamation of horror, and Mattern agreed in his mind that that solution would never do. [SNIPPET] The only way we can break into the big time ourselves is through hyperspace. We've got to do what's never been done before."" That wasn't quite true, from what the xhindi had told him, but near enough. It had been done before, but not very often, and not very recently. However, it had been done, so it was possible to do. Otherwise he wouldn't think of chancing it ... or would he? ""Why do you want money so much, Lennie?"""
2422,"First, I learned to slug down the national drink without batting an eye. Second, I learned to control my expression as I uncovered the fact that everything on New Texas was supersomething. I was also cautious enough, before we really got started, to leave my belt and guns with the purser. I didn't want Hoddy poking around those secret holsters. And I remember telling the captain to radio New Austin as soon as we came out of our last hyperspace-jump, then to send the ship's doctor around to give me my hangover treatments. But the one thing I wanted to remember, as the hangover shots brought me back to normal life, I found was the one thing I couldn't remember. What was the name of that girl—a big, beautiful blond—who joined the party along with Hoddy's grass widow from Alderbaran and stayed with it to the end? [SNIPPET] I got Hoddy out of the suite as soon as the ship had passed out of the normal space-time continuum, locked the door of my cabin and opened the parcel. It contained only two loose-leaf notebooks, both labeled with the Solar League and Department seals, both adorned with the customary bloodthirsty threats against the unauthorized and the indiscreet. They were numbered ONE and TWO. ONE contained four pages. On the first, I read:"
2423,"I've been awake for fourteen hours, driving off and on for ten of them; I'm about to drive for another six; and then I'm to stand by for more."" ""Would you like me to do some of the driving?"" asked Zaino. ""I guess you'll have to, whether I like it or not,"" was the rather lukewarm reply. "" I'll keep on for awhile, though—until we're back in better light. [SNIPPET] Mardikian and Schlossberg believed it to be a lava sheet dating from early in Mercury's history, when more volatile substances still existed in the surface rocks to cut down their viscosity when molten. They supposed that much—perhaps most—of the surface around the ""twilight"" belt had been flooded by this very liquid lava, which had cooled to a smoother surface than most Earthly lava flows. How long it had stayed cool they didn't guess. But both men felt sure that Mercury must have periodic upheavals as heat accumulated inside it—heat coming not from radioactivity but from tidal energy. Mercury's orbit is highly eccentric. At perihelion, tidal force tries to pull it apart along the planet-to-sun line, while at aphelion the tidal force is less and the little world's own gravity tries to bring it back to a spherical shape."
2424,"And there was Melbourne, and the strange conversation at the Club. Finally there was this amazing and isolated recollection, like a passage from a dream. Suddenly, as I went back to my bath and plunged into the cool water, my mind returned to Melbourne. I had been walking home with him that night from the Club—perhaps last night. We had gone on a while in silence, both of us thinking. Then we had[Pg 27] come to the Drive. At that moment Melbourne had said something—what was it? [SNIPPET] Even a sort of communism?"" ""In a sense. Rather it is an automatic life. The soul of the machine pervades us all, and the machines are beautiful. Our lives are logically and inevitably directed by environment and heredity[Pg 24] just as the machines are inevitably directed by their functions and capabilities. When a child is born, we know already what he will do throughout his life, how long he will live, what sort of children he will have, the woman he will marry. The Bureau could tell you at this moment when my great-grandson will be born, when he will die, and what his life will do for the State."
2425,"Along the base of these red cliffs, some distance above the ground, I could see a number of dark holes through the glass, which I conjectured to be the mouths of caves. At the opening of one of these something white was shimmering, but I was unable to make out what it was. I sat charting the country until the sun had set and it was so dark that I could no longer distinguish details. Then I climbed down to my companions waiting for me so eagerly at the bottom of the great tree. For once I was the hero of the expedition. [SNIPPET] In front of them a porter pushes a trolley piled high with trunks, wraps, and gun-cases. Professor Summerlee, a long, melancholy figure, walks with dragging steps and drooping head, as one who is already profoundly sorry for himself. Lord John Roxton steps briskly, and his thin, eager face beams forth between his hunting-cap and his muffler. As for myself, I am glad to have got the bustling days of preparation and the pangs of leave-taking behind me, and I have no doubt that I show it in my bearing."
2426,"A rustle. It might have been made by heavy space-boots. It came, and then it stopped. It came again, and stopped once more. As if skulking forms paused to find their way. Out where the ancient and ghostly buildings were, he saw a star wink out briefly, as if a shape blocked the path of its light. [SNIPPET] ""... Haw-haw-haw! Drop over to our camp sometime for a little drink, and a little game, eh, pantywaist? Tain't far. Sure—just drop in on us when the pressure of domesticity in this beootiful country gets you down.... When the turnips get you down! Haw-haw-haw! Bring the wife along.... She's kinda pretty. Ought to have a man-size fella.... Just ask for me—Alf Neely!"
2427,"A heavy object suddenly arced through the headlights, swinging on a vine. It disappeared behind a tree. Another. Another. Ghostly shadows with vine pendulums on both sides. Something banged down heavily onto the hood of the sled. [SNIPPET] Do we not look strange to you?” “I take it there’s been a heavy mutational variation in the humanoid norm on this planet,” said Orne. “ What is it? Hard radiation?” No answer."
2428,"Kirth-Labbery's genius had at last evolved a time machine. That was the one escape, the escape which the scientist had not yet tested and rather distrusted. And Lavra had poked the green button because Norbert Holt had said she had poked (would poke?) the green button. How many buttons could a wood poke poke if a wood poke would poke. ""The breakfast didn't seem to agree with him, doctor."" ""Maybe it was the paper. [SNIPPET] Won't be much, of course; but I always say a single man's got only one mouth to feed—and if he feeds more, he won't be single long!"" ""A little,"" said Vyrko with a glance at the newspaper headlines, ""might go a long way."" It did. There was the loan itself, which gave him a bank account on which, in turn, he could acquire other short-term loans—at exorbitant interest. And there was the election."
2429,"[160]   The boys' half of the dressing room (two-thirds really) was bustling. There was the smell of spirit gum and Max Factor and just plain men. Several guys were getting dressed or un-, and Bruce was cussing Bloody-something because he'd just burnt his fingers unwinding from the neck of a hot electric bulb some crepe hair he'd wound there to dry after wetting and stretching it to turn it from crinkly to straight for his Banquo beard. Bruce is always getting to the theater late and trying shortcuts. [SNIPPET] And as for you, Miss Nefer, I added a shade invidiously, you just keep on sitting cold in Central Park, warmed by dry-ice smoke from braziers, and keep your mouth shut and everything'll be fine. I'm sincerely glad you'll be able to be Queen Elizabeth all night long. Just so long as you don't try to steal the scene from Martin and the rest of the cast, and the real play. I suppose that camp chair will get a little uncomfortable by the time the Fifth Act comes tramping along to that drumbeat, but I'm sure you're so much in character you'll never feel it. One thing though: just don't scare me again pretending to work witchcraft—with a virginals or any other way."
2430,"Mr. Rapp asked. "" But ... I mean, that's all superstition, isn't it? And anyway ... well, television sets!"" ""They used to dry up cows, but who keeps cows?"" [SNIPPET] ""Right,"" said Mr. Rapp. ""Only the picture—"" the repairman paused, trying to find the right phrase. "" I mean, the picture's flipped. Like, it's wrong side up, too. Only, right side up, now."""
2431,"But aren't you afraid that your other patients will find out?"" The doctor stopped, his face paling slightly. "" I took an oath when I graduated from medical school. Sometimes I want to break that oath, but I have not so far."" He paused. "" Try as I may I cannot blame them for hating you. You know why."" [SNIPPET] Instinctively he set to hear it. The faces below him did not change. He turned away quickly then and went back out on the porch. He filled his pipe and sat down in the old, creaky rocker. A tiny rain had begun to fall hesitantly—as if afraid of striking the sun-hardened ground."
2432,"‘Good-bye, Sir.’  ‘Good-bye.’  With stealthy steps Sam Weller departed, leaving Mr. Pickwick alone in the garden.  Lights occasionally appeared in the different windows of the house, or glanced from the staircases, as if the inmates were retiring to rest. Not caring to go too near the door, until the appointed time, Mr. Pickwick crouched into an angle of the wall, and awaited its arrival. [SNIPPET] Damn that boy, he’s gone to sleep again. Be good enough to pinch him, sir—in the leg, if you please; nothing else wakes him—thank you. Undo the hamper, Joe.’  The fat boy, who had been effectually roused by the compression of a portion of his leg between the finger and thumb of Mr. Winkle, rolled off the box once again, and proceeded to unpack the hamper with more expedition than could have been expected from his previous inactivity.  ‘Now we must sit close,’ said the stout gentleman. After a great many jokes about squeezing the ladies’ sleeves, and a vast quantity of blushing at sundry jocose proposals, that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen’s laps, the whole party were stowed down in the barouche; and the stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy (who had mounted up behind for the purpose) into the carriage."
2433,"She will make an excellent companion to the fortunate man who wins her. When I remember the hard life she has led so far, I confess I cannot help sympathising with her; but surely I am not in love?"" I regret to say that my friend the astronomer, with all his good qualities, was not quite free from the arrogance which leads some men of science to assume a proprietary right in the objects of their discovery. To hear him speak you would think he had created the stars, instead of explaining a secret of their constitution. [SNIPPET] Mr. Carmichael descended by the trap into the engine room, while we others stood on the landing beside the open door, mute and expectant. Presently, a shudder of the vessel sent a strange thrill to our hearts, and almost before we knew it, we had left the ground. ""We're off!"" ejaculated Gazen, and although a slight vibration was all the movement we could feel, we saw the earth sinking away from us. At first we rose very slowly, because the machine had to contend against the force of gravity; but as the weight of the car diminished the higher we ascended, our speed gradually augmented, and we knew that in the long run it would become prodigious."
2434,"It was the beginning. In most instances patients reported the attack struck with almost the impact of a physical blow. The prodromal symptoms were usually slight ... a sudden feeling of uneasiness and guilt ... hot and cold flashes ... dizziness ... double vision. Then this ghastly sense of depression coupled with a blind insensate rage at life. One man said he felt as if the world were closing in on him. Another that he felt the people around him were plotting his destruction. One housewife made her husband lock her in her room for fear she would injure the children. [SNIPPET] Their sex life was generally satisfactory. There was no history of mental illness in the family. In fact, the only thing that seemed to be the matter with them was that there were times when they felt like hell. LATHAM. I suppose you tried tranquilizers?"
2435,"I have never swerved from my purpose for a moment’s space; but if I had, one thought of her uncomplaining, suffering look, as she drooped away, or of the starving face of our innocent child, would have nerved me to my task. My first act of requital you well remember: this is my last.”  ‘The old man shivered, and his hands dropped powerless by his side.  ‘“I leave England to-morrow,” said Heyling, after a moment’s pause. “ To-night I consign you to the living death to which you devoted her—a hopeless prison—”  ‘He raised his eyes to the old man’s countenance, and paused. He lifted the light to his face, set it gently down, and left the apartment. [SNIPPET] It was accordingly settled that Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass, should all wear fancy-dresses. Thus Mr. Pickwick was led by the very warmth of his own good feelings to give his consent to a proceeding from which his better judgment would have recoiled—a more striking illustration of his amiable character could hardly have been conceived, even if the events recorded in these pages had been wholly imaginary.  Mr. Leo Hunter had not exaggerated the resources of Mr. Solomon Lucas. His wardrobe was extensive—very extensive—not strictly classical perhaps, not quite new, nor did it contain any one garment made precisely after the fashion of any age or time, but everything was more or less spangled; and what can be prettier than spangles!"
2436,"The CIA man gestured impatiently. "" War games simulations aren't new. You've been doing them for years."" ""Yes, but this machine is different,"" Ford pointed out. "" It not only gives a much more detailed war game. [SNIPPET] It was cheaper to build a deterrent than to defend against it. The missiles flashed up from submarines and railway cars, from underground silos and stratospheric jets; secret ones fired off automatically when a certain airbase command post ceased beaming out a restraining radio signal. The defensive systems were simply overloaded. And when the bombs ran out, the missiles carried dust and germs and gas."
2437,"""Sorry, Mr. Bezdek,"" said Ty Falter, the mogul's private secretary, bodyguard and constant companion. He was leaning against the far wall of the corridor, mopping a cut lower lip with a bloody handkerchief. He was a tall, deceptively sleepy-looking young man who virtually never slept. At the end of the corridor two lesser aides were half-dragging a tall figure between them. Bezdek frowned as he caught a glimpse of a nodding head in half profile—a near-perfect profile which showed no sign of a bruise. ""How did that creep get in here?"" [SNIPPET] The banker, who was new to the movie-making branch of his business, spoke first. "" I presume,"" he said finally, ""that you're aware of the current feeling in our New York office?"" The movie magnate gestured carelessly with a Saxony gun-club sleeve, revealing a platinum wristwatch strap. "" We hear rumors now and again,"" he said. """
2438,"So he and Sir Lancelot encountered first, and Sir Galahad smote down his father. Then drawing his sword, for his spear was broken, he fought with Sir Percival, and struck so mightily that he clave Sir Percival’s helm, and smote him from his horse.  Now hard by where they fought there was a hermitage, where dwelt a pious woman, a recluse, who, when she heard the sound, came forth, and seeing Sir Galahad ride, she cried, “God be with thee, the best knight in the world; had yonder knights known thee as well as I do, they would not have encountered with thee.”  When Sir Galahad heard that, fearing to be made known, he forthwith smote his horse with his spurs, and departed at a great pace.  Sir Lancelot and Sir Percival heard her words also, and rode fast after him, but within awhile he was out of their sight. [SNIPPET] Then came on Calibere, a huge Pavian, but Sir Bors overthrew him also. And then the company of Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere brake from their ambush and fell on the Romans, and slew and hewed them down, and forced them to return and flee, chasing them to their tents.  But as they neared the camp, a great host more rushed forth, and turned the battle backwards, and in the turmoil, Sir Bors and Sir Berel fell into the Romans’ hands. When Sir Gawain saw that, he drew his good sword Galotine, and swore to see King Arthur’s face no more if those two knights were not delivered; and then, with good Sir Idrus, made so sore an onslaught that the Romans fled and left Sir Bors and Sir Berel to their friends. So the Britons returned in triumph to King Arthur, having slain more than ten thousand Romans, and lost no man of worship from amongst themselves.  When the Emperor Lucius heard of that discomfiture he arose, with all his army, to crush King Arthur, and met him in the vale of Soissons. Then speaking to all his host, he said, “Sirs, I admonish you that this day ye fight and acquit yourselves as men; and remembering how Rome is chief of all the earth, and mistress of the universal world, suffer not these barbarous and savage Britons to abide our onset.”"
2439,"Rudimentary organs, on the other hand, are essentially useless, as teeth which never cut through the gums; in a still less developed condition, they would be of still less use. They cannot, therefore, under their present condition, have been formed by natural selection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications; they have been retained, as we shall see, by inheritance, and relate to a former condition of their possessor. It is difficult to know what are nascent organs; looking to the future, we cannot of course tell how any part will be developed, and whether it is now nascent; looking to the past, creatures with an organ in a nascent condition will generally have been supplanted and exterminated by their successors with the organ in a more perfect and developed condition. The wing of the penguin is of high service, and acts as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the wings of birds; not that I believe this to be the case, it is more probably a reduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx is useless, and is truly rudimentary.

2440,"He may have perfected a device that would enable a soldier to avoid capture, but there would certainly be other ways to kill him than by bullets. Let’s see now: suppose that the enemy shot a flamethrower at him. The burning materials might pass through him, but he would be cooked anyway. Or poison gas—” [p 63]“Hm-m-m. As far as gas goes, I suppose a gas mask would be necessary. Busch doesn’t know about the breathing mechanism, except that he had to take breaths. [SNIPPET] “Isn’t it obvious? A machine that would enable a man to walk through walls. And Busch has no idea how the thing works, other than the general explanation that Duvall gave him. And Busch was poles apart from Duvall."
2441,"Yet all my insistence profited me nothing, for the nurses were a silent lot. Finally, I think, they must have given me a sleeping potion of some sort, for I fell asleep again. For two endless, chaotic days, I saw nothing of either of them, Alice or Sir John. I became more and more agitated, the nurse more and more taciturn. She would only say that they had gone away for a day or two. And then, on the third day, I found out. They thought I was asleep. [SNIPPET] So, slowly, the old emotions were shed away from me, and I began to joy in a corresponding growth of my mental perceptions. I began to toy idly with mathematical formulae I had forgotten years ago, in the same fashion that a poet toys with a word and its shades of meaning. I would look at everything with new, seeing eyes, new perception, and I would understand things I had never understood before, because formerly my emotions had always occupied me more than my thoughts. And so the weeks went by, until, one day, I was well."
2442,"The man shook his head like one recovering from a dream. "" I do' know,"" he said, ""they had the helmets on me for twenty periods. I do' know nothing. We came through that door. In the little automobiles."" [SNIPPET] Again. Miss. Out of the tail of his eye he saw the line of green leap into being again. Flap, flap went the wings beneath him. Suddenly from below and behind him there rose a deep humming roar, low pitched and musical. Abruptly the screaming of the bird ceased; it dropped suddenly away, its forewings folded, the rear wings spread, glider-like as it floated to the ground. He turned to look in the direction of the sound, and as he turned a great glare of light sprang forth from somewhere back there, striking him full in the eyes with blinding force."
2443,"If the expert had been enthusiastic on a former occasion, he was ten times more so on this. He spoke in terms almost of rapture about the violin. He had compared it with two magnificent instruments in the collection of the late Mr. James Loding, then the finest in Europe; and it was admittedly superior to either, both in the delicate markings of its wood and singularly fine varnish. "" Of its tone,"" he said, ""we cannot, of course, yet pronounce with certainty, but I am very sure that its voice will not belie its splendid exterior. [SNIPPET] At first I thought it was a heap of dust or refuse, but on looking closer it seemed rather a bundle of rags. As my eyes penetrated the gloom, I saw there was about it some tattered cloth of a faded green tint, and almost at the same minute I seemed to trace under the clothes the lines or dimensions of a human figure. For a moment I imagined it was some poor man lying face downwards and bent up against the wall. The idea of a man or of a dead body being there shocked me violently, and I cried to my brother, ""Tell me, what is it?"" At that instant the light from."
2444,"""Delirious my eye! He's as quiet as a lamb. And you've tied him down so tightly that the straps are cutting right into him! Of all the—the—"" He stopped, evidently feeling words futile, and before we could make an effective attempt to stop him, whipped out a knife and cut the straps. Tristan's unfortunate body instantly crashed against the ceiling, smashing the lathing and plaster, and remaining half embedded in the ruins. A low cry of pain rose from Alice. Dr. Grosnoff staggered to a chair and sat down, his eyes fixed on the ceiling with a steady stare—the odd caricature of a man coolly studying an interesting phenomenon. [SNIPPET] The world was beginning to seem a pretty awful place. Grosnoff saw my disturbance, and placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. ""I'm afraid,"" he said, smiling, ""that I rather yielded to the temptation to get a rise out of you. That suggestion might be unpleasantly true under special circumstances."
2445,"In fact, his conduct approached that of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz’s very nose.  The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling. François swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. [SNIPPET] They told us we couldn’t make White River, and here we are.” This last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.  “And they told you true,” John Thornton answered. “ The bottom’s likely to drop out at any moment."
2446,"A coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels. Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple, the purple the painter called ""the color of grapes on Judgment Day."" The medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a turnstile. The woman had a lot of facial hair—an unmistakable mustache, in fact. [SNIPPET] ""That is kind of like what I do,"" she said. She was demure about what she did. What she did was make people comfortable while she killed them. And, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living. ""Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!"""
2447,"If he could but once see her face to face, he was sure that he could bring her back. A week from the day on which she had fled he was starting out as usual, early in the morning, for another day of hopeless, weary tramping in the city, when the postman handed him a letter addressed in her handwriting. It was to him like a voice from the grave, and read as follows:— Paul replied with the first love-letter he had ever written, and one that any woman who loved him must have found irresistible. He enclosed a note from Miss Ludington, assuring Ida of the unhappiness which her flight had caused them, the undiminished tenderness which they cherished for her; and the cruelty she would be guilty of if she refused to return. In response to these letters there came a note saying simply, ""I will come."" On the evening of the day this note was received, as Paul and Miss Ludington were together in the sitting-room talking as usual of Ida, and wondering on what day she would return, there was a light step at, the open door, and she glided into the room, and, throwing herself on her knees before Miss Ludington, hid her face in her lap. [SNIPPET] The absence of anything like self-consciousness in the delight she took in these tributes to the charms of her girlish self was pathetic in its completeness. It was indeed not as herself, but as another, that she thought of this fair girl, who had vanished from the earth, leaving a picture as her sole memento. How, indeed, could it be otherwise when she looked from the picture to the looking-glass, and contrasted the images? She mourned for her girlish self, which had been so cruelly effaced from the world of life, as for a person, near and precious to her beyond the power of words to express, who had died. From the time that she had first risen from the sick-bed, where she had suffered so sad a transformation, nothing could induce her to put on the brightly coloured gowns, beribboned, and ruffled, and gaily trimmed, which she had worn as a girl; and as soon as she was able she carefully folded and put them away in lavender, like relics of the dead. For herself, she dressed henceforth in drab or black. For three or four years she remained more or less an invalid."
2448,"He poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful not to let the sardines fall in. When he had squeezed the last drop of oil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the sink. Bonnie went after the salt and, when she lifted out the box, she found a package containing two chocolate graham crackers. ""Mom has a new hiding place, Bob,"" she announced. Bob looked up. "" Where is it?"" ""Behind the salt."" [SNIPPET] She had never seen such self-sacrifice. The act made her aware, for the first time, of the immense significance of the experiment. She dropped her quarrel completely and walked over to the sink to get a good look at what was being done. All she saw in the sink was a wadded, wet Corn Flake box, the empty sardine tin and spillings from the juicer, which by this time was beginning to take on a distinctive and unpleasant odor."
2449,"Eyes like stars. The eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of Vauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand. I regained my health gradually. ""Are you quite awake?"" Vauna would ask me in her musical Benzendella words. "" You speak better today. [SNIPPET] When she does, she'll declare you her mate. And the tribe will be proud. Have you thought this through?"" ""I've tried to."" I began to pace. "" You know we can't afford to offend the tribe. If you bluntly deny that you've had anything to do with the girl, they'll be insulted."
2450,"It was then that they saw the first of the yellow bands. It was just that: a band of bright yellow some thirty centimeters wide, about five meters long, and so thin as to seem insubstantial, a mere stripe of color. It came underneath the backdrop behind the announcer. It streaked about the casting room with questing sinuosity. [SNIPPET] Their cure, even their palliation, had been forgotten. And mankind coughed and sneezed and itched ... and died. For while the allergies of the ancient past produced only agonies to make the patient long for death, agnoton brought on racking and incessant spasms of coughing and sneezing which no heart could long withstand. ""So if you leave this shelter, my dear,"" Vyrko concluded, ""you too will fight for every breath and twist your body in torment until your heart decides that it is all just too much trouble. Here we are safe, because your father's eczema was the only known case of allergy in centuries—and was traced to the inert gases. Here is the only air-conditioning in the world that excludes the inert gases—and with them agnoton. And here—"""
2451,"Now, what DO I mean by THE BEST WAYS TO GET AROUND? Briefly, by the word BEST, I mean so pseudo-logical that you could almost leave off the ""pseudo"". See? ( No) For instance, Jack Williamson's geodesic machinery, wherein he warps space around, appeals to me as being pure fairy tale stuff. [SNIPPET] She opened her mouth, and her tongue unrolled, uncoiled toward Redforth. Three feet long, the tongue was filamental, like a strand of red cobweb, tipped by a touch of fluff like a dandelion's seed. This member wandered lightly over Redforth's cheek, and for the first time EIRY spoke: ""It comes to me that here is the man for whom we have been seeking, Yasgorphitove."" Her voice was soft as clouds."
2452,"It rocked back and forth in front of Four. It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, ""Fweep? Fweep?"" Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her face. "" Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!"" [SNIPPET] Grampa called. Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like some reedy folk music. ""Makes you think, doesn't it?"" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly. """
2453,"When did I meet you?"" ""Oh, years ago! I was just a kid!"" She flushed, and he realized he'd been a little tactless. If he was no kid any more, neither would she be. [SNIPPET] Either he felt that she would interfere with the smooth operation of their business, or he was jealous of a third intruding into their company. ""I have done everything I did for the sake of winning Lyddy,"" Mattern said, biting off the words. "" If all hope of her is gone, then my whole reason for working with you is gone. I will never go back to hyperspace."" ""There are other women—"" ""Not for me!"" ""The business itself means nothing to you?"""
2454,"""You're a faithful old chap,"" said Subway Smith, thickly. "" Hanged if I'd do A.D.T. work till three A.M. for anybody.""  ""I came at ten, Mr. Montgomery, with a message from Mr. Brewster, wishing you many happy returns of the day, and with a check from him for one thousand dollars. Here's the check, sir. I'll give my messages in the order I received them, sir, if you please. At twelve-thirty o'clock, I came with a message from Dr. Gower, sir, who had been called in—""  ""Called in?"" [SNIPPET] Something must be done, he realized, to earn his living. Perhaps the role of the princely profligate would be easier in Italy than anywhere else. He studied the outlook from every point of view, but there were moments when it seemed hopeless. Baedeker was provokingly barren of suggestions for extravagance and Monty grew impatient of the book's small economies."
2455,"Then as her interest mounted and Vyrko began to compliment himself on his ability as an instructor, they became certain of their success; and from that point on she was rapt with the fascination of the changes in herself. But even this new development did not totally rid Vyrko of his own ennui. If there were only something he could do, some positive, Vristian, Kirth-Labberian step that he could take! He damned himself for having been an incompetent aesthetic fool, who had taken so for granted the scientific wonders of his age that he had never learned what made them tick, or how greater wonders might be attained. He slept too much, he ate too much, for a brief period he drank too much—until he found boredom even less attractive with a hangover. [SNIPPET] He found Lavra in the laboratory, of all unexpected places. She was staring fixedly at one corner, where the light did not strike clearly. ""What's so fascinating?"" Vyrko asked. Lavra turned suddenly. Her hair and her flesh rippled with the perfect grace of the movement. """
2456,"There aren't many of us."" Captain Entwhistle seemed to come out of a dream. "" Of course, of course. Come on. We can discuss things better in my cabin."" As they mounted to the deck of the Brisbane, even the trained sailors, the light blue of their faces oddly at variance with the dark blue of their uniforms, could not refrain from staring at the colonists. [SNIPPET] Eleven hands went up. Gloria looked around at those who remained recalcitrant and concentrated her gaze on Stevens. "" Won't you join us, Mr. Stevens?"" she asked sweetly. ""I don't think this is the way to do things,"" said the Wall Street man with a touch of asperity. "" It's altogether irregular and no permanent good can result from it."
2457,"He blew a hole in the skirt of my kimono, bless his shaky old hand, but we got a jacket on him, and he's to be all right in a week. I say, young fellah, I hope you don't mind—what? You see, between you an' me close-tiled, I look on this South American business as a mighty serious thing, and if I have a pal with me I want a man I can bank on. So I sized you down, and I'm bound to say that you came well out of it. You see, it's all up to you and me, for this old Summerlee man will want dry-nursin' from the first. [SNIPPET] I had been plottin' it out a bit, and had one or two things clear in my mind. It was all on me, for Summerlee was useless and Challenger not much better. The only time they got together they got slangin' because they couldn't agree upon the scientific classification of these red-headed devils that had got hold of us. One said it was the dryopithecus of Java, the other said it was pithecanthropus. Madness, I call it—Loonies, both. But, as I say, I had thought out one or two points that were helpful."
2458,"Saw him do it.”  Mrs. Batch gave a low moan.  “Katie’s fainted,” added the Messenger, not without a touch of personal pride.  “Saw him do it,” Mrs. Batch repeated dully. “ Katie,” she said, in the same voice, “get up this instant.” But Katie did not hear her.  The mother was loth to have been outdone in sensibility by the daughter, and it was with some temper that she hastened to make the necessary ministrations. [SNIPPET] To ‘the giddy vulgar’ any sort of victory is pleasant. But defeat? If, when that war was declared, every one had been sure that not only should we fail to conquer the Transvaal, but that IT would conquer US—that not only would it make good its freedom and independence, but that we should forfeit ours—how would the cits have felt then? Would they not have pulled long faces, spoken in whispers, wept? You must forgive me for saying that the noise you have just made around this table was very like to the noise made on the verge of the Boer War. And your procedure seems to me as unaccountable as would have seemed the antics of those mobs if England had been plainly doomed to disaster and to vassalage."
2459,"Don’t you find the rooms comfortable?” she asked, gazing up at him. “ Have you ever had any complaint to make about the attendance?”  “No,” said the Duke, “the attendance has always been quite satisfactory. I have never felt that so keenly as I do to-day.”  “Then why are you leaving? Why are you breaking my heart?” [SNIPPET] To-night I shall be among the shades. There be not you, my brothers.”  Good though the sermon was in style and sentiment, the flaw in its reasoning was too patent for any converts to be made. As he walked out of the quadrangle, the Duke felt the hopelessness of his cause. Still he battled bravely for it up the High, waylaying, cajoling, commanding, offering vast bribes. He carried his crusade into the Loder, and thence into Vincent’s, and out into the street again, eager, untiring, unavailing: everywhere he found his precept checkmated by his example.  The sight of The MacQuern coming out top-speed from the Market, with a large but inexpensive bunch of flowers, reminded him of the luncheon that was to be."
2460,"""After all,"" said I, ""tis a feminine trait. Souvent femme varie."" ""Oh, she is constant to her lord the sun,"" rejoined Gazen. "" She never turns her back upon him, but if I have not discovered a mare's nest, which is very likely, she becks and bows to him a good deal, and thus maintains her 'infinite variety.'"" The cloudy surface of Mercury now lay far beneath us, and the glowing disc of the sun, which appeared four or five times larger than it does on the earth, had taken a bluish tinge—a proof that we had reached a very great altitude. [SNIPPET] Since an unfit employment is a mistake, and a source of unhappiness, everyone is free to choose the work that suits his nature. Parents and teachers only help him to discover himself. One is called to his work by a love for it, and the pleasure he takes in doing it easily and well. If his bent is vague or tardy, he is allowed to change, and feel his way to it by trial."
2461,"Passengers got up and passengers got down, and fresh horses came and went and came again, with scarcely any interval between each team as it seemed to those who were dozing, and with a gap of a whole night between every one as it seemed to those who were broad awake. At length they began to jolt and rumble over horribly uneven stones, and Mr Pecksniff looking out of window said it was to-morrow morning, and they were there.  Very soon afterwards the coach stopped at the office in the city; and the street in which it was situated was already in a bustle, that fully bore out Mr Pecksniff’s words about its being morning, though for any signs of day yet appearing in the sky it might have been midnight. There was a dense fog too; as if it were a city in the clouds, which they had been travelling to all night up a magic beanstalk; and there was a thick crust upon the pavement like oilcake; which, one of the outsides (mad, no doubt) said to another (his keeper, of course), was Snow.  Taking a confused leave of Anthony and his son, and leaving the luggage of himself and daughters at the office to be called for afterwards, Mr Pecksniff, with one of the young ladies under each arm, dived across the street, and then across other streets, and so up the queerest courts, and down the strangest alleys and under the blindest archways, in a kind of frenzy; now skipping over a kennel, now running for his life from a coach and horses; now thinking he had lost his way, now thinking he had found it; now in a state of the highest confidence, now despondent to the last degree, but always in a great perspiration and flurry; until at length they stopped in a kind of paved yard near the Monument. That is to say, Mr Pecksniff told them so; for as to anything they could see of the Monument, or anything else but the buildings close at hand, they might as well have been playing blindman’s buff at Salisbury. [SNIPPET] I came here purposely to tell you, but I think I should have wanted courage if you had not chanced to lead me so directly to the object of my coming.’  Tom gazed at her steadfastly, and seemed to say, ‘What else?’ But he said not a word.  ‘That person whom you think the best of men,’ said Mary, looking up, and speaking with a quivering lip and flashing eye."
2462,"Thus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by descent with modification, from two or more species of the same genus. And the two or [124]more parent-species are supposed to have descended from some one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram, this is indicated by the broken lines, beneath the capital letters, converging in sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point representing a single species, the supposed single parent of our several new sub-genera and genera. It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new species F14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character, but to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree. In this case, its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Having descended from a form which stood between the two parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents, the new species (F14) will not be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind.

2463,"The ship was a red-lit cavern. The ""crewman"" turned out to be a hairy horror, a three-foot headless lump shaped like an eggplant, supported by four splayed legs and with an indefinite number of tentacles wriggling below the stalked eyes. ""They're more like us than you'd think,"" said the guide. "" They're mammals, they have a nervous organization very like ours, they're susceptible to some of our diseases—which is very rare—and they even share some of our minor vices."" He opened his kit and offered the thing a plug of chewing tobacco, which was refused with much tentacle-waving, and a cigar, which was accepted. [SNIPPET] There were handkerchiefs in the kit, he recalled suddenly. And he remembered what the guide had said about Aurigean air. He tugged the kit open, fumbled and found a handkerchief. He zipped open the closure of his helmet and tilted the helmet back."
2464,"Tell me how to speak to them."" ""It may take a little time. Think at them. Try to listen. [SNIPPET] ""What good is it now?"" said the Astronomer, bitterly. "" There's nothing left. There'll be no second landing. This ship detected life on our planet through accident. Other exploring parties would come no closer than necessary to establish the fact that there were no super-dense worlds existing in our solar system."""
2465,"cried many a shrill feminine voice. “ Don’t push!” “ Let me out!” “ You brute!” “ Save me, save me!” Many ladies fainted, whilst their escorts, supporting them and protecting them as best they could, peered over the heads of their fellows for one glimpse of the divine Miss Dobson. Yet for her and the Duke, in the midst of the terrific compress, there was space enough. [SNIPPET] If his be an ardent nature, the quicker his transition. All the most ardent of my past adorers have married. Will you put my cup down, please?”  “Past?”"
2466,"Give them credit for being good and often logical guessers, perhaps—but don't claim that as a merit for their WRITING! And how many other good guessers must there have been who never got around to setting down their predictions in print? There is but one affectation about Wells' ""scientific"" stories which he published before he discovered his capability at characterization, and this is the affectation of imagination. There is no genuine imagination in beating out cleverness of the s.f. type; the point of view, the inventive quality necessary for their construction, is the same as with the widely circulated tales of Nick Carter. Science-fiction stories are not struck forth with a creative hand, they are manufactured products put together piece-meal—none of them being written in any but the calmest and most conscious mood. They are lacking in that important element of all really GREAT works of the imagination: inspiration. [SNIPPET] He grew a Van Dyke on the left side of his face and his left hand was stained with acids and chemicals. But the right side of his face became dissipated and disreputable, with a leer in the eye end a scornful, sneering curve to the lip. He grew a tiny moustache on the right side, waxed it, and twirled it continually. It was rather horrid, but worse was yet to come."
2467,"he said. “ We’ll be at th’ rebs in less’n an hour. What’s th’ good fightin’ ’mong ourselves?”  One of the light-footed soldiers turned upon him red-faced and violent. “ Yeh needn’t come around here with yer preachin’. [SNIPPET] The youth and his friend of a sudden looked up, feeling a deadened form of distress at the waning of these noises, which had become a part of life. They could see changes going on among the troops. There were marchings this way and that way. A battery wheeled leisurely. On the crest of a small hill was the thick gleam of many departing muskets.  The youth arose. “"
2468,"Solomon trudged back, followed by the short civilian and patrolman who left their curious searching to follow Solomon's lead. When he neared, the tall stranger asked, ""I see where weeds grew under other cars which, from the tracks, have been moved out in the past few weeks. How many did you have?"" ""Twenty; but these are all I have left,"" Solomon eagerly replied, hoping at last he'd a customer for the best of his old cars. "" [SNIPPET] Quietly a cavalcade formed, converged in Solomon's front yard and parked facing the road ready for quick departure. Some dozen civilians muddied shoes and trousers circling the junk yard, taking stations so they could watch all approaches. Once they were in position, a Highway patrolman and two civilians went to Solomon's door. His last cup of coffee was almost gone as Solomon heard the noise of their shoes, followed by knuckles thumping his front door."
2469,"When he did—kill or be killed. Of course no one is actually hurt. That is the beauty of the machine. It allows one to settle a score, to work out aggressive feelings, without either mental or physical harm. [SNIPPET] Their eyes met, and Odal’s lips parted in a cold smile. Dulaq hurried up the ramp. Odal was gone by the time he reached the upper level. He could not have gotten far, Dulaq reasoned. Slowly, but very surely, Dulaq’s hallucination turned into a nightmare. He spotted Odal in the crowd, only to have him melt away. He saw him again, lolling in a small park, but when he got closer, the man turned out to be another stranger."
2470,"During all those years I had studied ceaselessly, and my mind had been clear and quick as the day I first had left the hospital. But all that time I had been able only to remain what I was—an extraordinarily intelligent man of the twentieth century. And the rest of the race had been progressing! It had been swiftly gathering knowledge and power and ability all that time, faster and faster, while I had been only remaining still. And now here was Zarentzov and the teachers of the Universities, and, probably, a hundred intelligent men, who had all outstripped me! I was being left behind. And that is what happened. [SNIPPET] ""But, Dennell, you are too hasty. You must not put yourself so rashly into my hands."" ""You have perfected the operation, haven't you?"" ""That is true,"" he said. ""You must try it out on somebody, must you not?"" ""Yes, of course. And yet—somehow, Dennell, I am afraid."
2471,"Things a man finds out as he goes along. Look, I'm very fond of both of them. I know the difference. You're just confused by the slight resemblance."" The clincher was the problem of how Katha had reached Terra City ahead of Garrity, to begin with, and whether there was still a Katha in Serco. I asked a man off a ship fresh from Serco and he told me Katha hadn't been there for some time. [SNIPPET] You won't pry him off it and you might get him mad at you. A spaceship's too small to make enemies in. ""Suppose you get married,"" I asked him. "" So you have a place to go, and a girl in it, in one port."
2472,"Oh-oh. Now what?"" A flitabout had come to ground. Dark Lady, who never delivered a message via thought if she could possibly get away with delivering it in person, was running full tilt across the sand toward them. Her long black hair was streaming out behind her; she was waving a length of teletype tape as though it were a pennon. ""Oh, no. [SNIPPET] Take the rest of the day off and rest up. Put on your thought-screens and don't take them off for a second from now on. Those Stretts are tough hombres."" Sandra was the last to leave. "" And you, boss?"" she asked pointedly. ""I've got some thinking to do."""
2473,"You reckon that colonel's commission that Congress up in Washington-on-the-Brazos give him swelled his head?"" Rather stiffly, Ord said, ""Colonel, the commandant desires an officers' conference in the chapel, now."" Ord was somewhat annoyed. He had not realized he would find these Americans so—distasteful. Hardly preferable to Mexicans, really. Not at all as he had imagined. [SNIPPET] We aren't like the Mexicans, always pushing, always grabbing off New Mexico, Arizona, California. We aren't colonial oppressors, thank God! No, it wouldn't have worked out, even if we American immigrants had secured our rights in Texas—"" He lifted a short, heavy, percussion pistol in his hand and cocked it. "" I hate to say it, but perhaps if we hadn't taken Payne and Jefferson so seriously—if we could only have paid lip service, and done what we really wanted to do, in our hearts ... no matter. I won't live to see our final disgrace."" He put the pistol to his head and blew out his brains."
2474,"The whole story seemed to me now to resemble one of those puzzle pictures or maps which I have played with as a child, where each bit fits into some other until the outline is complete. It was as if I were finding the pieces one by one of a bygone history, and fitting them to one another until some terrible whole should be gradually built up and stand out in its complete deformity.  Dr. Empson spoke gravely of John's illness, and entertained without reluctance the proposal of Mrs. Temple, that Dr. Dobie, a celebrated physician in Derby, should be summoned to a consultation. Dr. Dobie came more than once, and was at last able to report an amendment in John's condition, though both the doctors absolutely forbade anyone to visit him, and said that under the most favourable circumstances a period of some weeks must elapse before he could be moved.  Mrs. Temple invited me to remain at Royston until my brother should be sufficiently convalescent to be moved; and both she and Constance, while regretting the cause, were good enough to express themselves pleased that accident should detain me so long with them.  As the reports of the doctors became gradually more favourable, and our minds were in consequence more free to turn to other subjects, I spoke to Mrs. Temple one day about the picture, saying that it interested me, and asking for some particulars as to the life of Adrian Temple. [SNIPPET] My brother was pleased with Mr. Gaskell's compliment, and the latter continued, ""Let me enjoy the pleasure of playing with you once more in Oxford; let us play the 'Areopagita.'""  And so saying he opened the pianoforte and sat down.  John was turning to take out the Stradivarius when he remembered that he had never even revealed its existence to Mr. Gaskell, and that if he now produced it an explanation must follow. In a moment his mood changed, and with less geniality he excused himself, somewhat awkwardly, from complying with the request, saying that he was fatigued.  Mr. Gaskell was evidently hurt at his friend's altered manner, and without renewing his petition rose at once from the pianoforte, and after a little forced conversation took his departure. On leaving he shook my brother by the hand, wished him all prosperity in his marriage and after-life, and said, ""Do not entirely forget your old comrade, and remember that if at any time you should stand in need of a true friend, you know where to find him!"""
2475,"Desperately I got my hands clasped together about his wrist, this last grip almost lifting me from the earth; his legs and remaining arm streamed fantastically skyward. Through the haze which seemed to be finally drowning my amazed and tortured soul, I knew that my fingers were slipping through one another, and that in another instant my brother would be gone. Gone—where? Why and how? There was a sudden shriek, and the impact of a frantic body against mine, as Alice, whom I had quite forgotten, made a skyward running jump and clasped the arm frantically to her bosom with both her own. [SNIPPET] There was a sudden shriek, and the impact of a frantic body against mine, as Alice, whom I had quite forgotten, made a skyward running jump and clasped the arm frantically to her bosom with both her own. With vast relief, I loosed my cramped fingers—only to feel her silken garments begin to slide skyward against my cheek. It was more instinct than sense which made me clutch at her legs. God, had I not done that! As it was, I held both forms anchored with only a slight pull, waiting dumbly for the next move—quite non compos by this time, I think. ""Quick, Jim!"""
2476,"‘I can introduce you to the agent, sir,’ said the General. ‘ I know him. In fact, I am a member of the Eden Land Corporation myself.’  This was serious news to Martin, for his friend had laid great stress upon the General’s having no connection, as he thought, with any land company, and therefore being likely to give him disinterested advice. The General explained that he had joined the Corporation only a few weeks ago, and that no communication had passed between himself and Mr Bevan since.  ‘We have very little to venture,’ said Martin anxiously—‘only a few pounds—but it is our all. Now, do you think that for one of my profession, this would be a speculation with any hope or chance in it?’ [SNIPPET] Then the village forge came out in all its bright importance. The lusty bellows roared Ha ha! to the clear fire, which roared in turn, and bade the shining sparks dance gayly to the merry clinking of the hammers on the anvil. The gleaming iron, in its emulation, sparkled too, and shed its red-hot gems around profusely. The strong smith and his men dealt such strokes upon their work, as made even the melancholy night rejoice, and brought a glow into its dark face as it hovered about the door and windows, peeping curiously in above the shoulders of a dozen loungers. As to this idle company, there they stood, spellbound by the place, and, casting now and then a glance upon the darkness in their rear, settled their lazy elbows more at ease upon the sill, and leaned a little further in: no more disposed to tear themselves away than if they had been born to cluster round the blazing hearth like so many crickets."
2477,"Your friend has pointed to the stars and told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the ship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make myself believe."" Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of forehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying to visualize the flight of a space ship. "" [SNIPPET] ""Yes, always."" ""Thank you, Jim."" She was weeping. I started to take her in my arms, but thought better of it. She dried her eyes. """
2478,"The entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a remarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and cheering for some minutes. An acute observer might, however, have detected some signs of dissent amid the applause, and gathered that the proceedings were likely to become more lively than harmonious. It may safely be prophesied, however, that no one could have foreseen the extraordinary turn which they were actually to take.  ""Of the appearance of the four wanderers little need be said, since their photographs have for some time been appearing in all the papers. They bear few traces of the hardships which they are said to have undergone. Professor Challenger's beard may be more shaggy, Professor Summerlee's features more ascetic, Lord John Roxton's figure more gaunt, and all three may be burned to a darker tint than when they left our shores, but each appeared to be in most excellent health. [SNIPPET] I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman. What has he done?""  The face flashed back again.  ""Went to South America on a solitary expedeetion two years ago. Came back last year. Had undoubtedly been to South America, but refused to say exactly where."
2479,"I didn't want Hoddy poking around those secret holsters. And I remember telling the captain to radio New Austin as soon as we came out of our last hyperspace-jump, then to send the ship's doctor around to give me my hangover treatments. But the one thing I wanted to remember, as the hangover shots brought me back to normal life, I found was the one thing I couldn't remember. What was the name of that girl—a big, beautiful blond—who joined the party along with Hoddy's grass widow from Alderbaran and stayed with it to the end? Damn, I wished I could remember her name! When we were fifteen thousand miles off-planet and the lighters from New Austin spaceport were reported on the way, I got into the skin-tight Levis, the cataclysmic-colored shirt, and the loose vest, tucked my big hat under my arm, and went to the purser's office for my guns, buckling them on. [SNIPPET] He hesitated for a moment. "" We don't want the New Texans to know, of course, that you've sent for the fleet?"" ""Naturally not."" ""Well, if I can wait till about midnight before I leave, I can get a boat owned, manned and operated by Solar League people. The boat's a dreadful-looking old tub, but she's sound and fast. The gang who own her are pretty notorious characters—suspected of smuggling, piracy, and what not—but they'll keep their mouths shut if well paid."" ""Then pay them well,"" I said. """
2480,"It will then uncouple, discharge one hopper, and go back on Mass-Time. Estimated time for this stage of descent forty minutes. ""Three. The hopper will then descend on its own engines at the maximum speed allowed by the heat-disposal system; estimated at thirty-seven minutes. Gilgamesh will complete descent in thirty-three minutes. Engines of Gilgamesh will not be used except for the heat-disposal and gyro auxiliaries. [SNIPPET] It is a strange thing, every time I see M'Clare I am startled all over again at how good-looking he is; seems I forget it between times which is maybe why I never fell for him as most female students do. However what strikes me this time is that he looks tired, three-days-sleepless tired with worries on top. I guess he is real, at that. He says, ""Don't look so accusing, Lizzie, I only just got on this ship myself."" This does not make sense; you cannot just arrive on a ship twenty-four hours after it goes on Mass-Time; or can you?"

Brookings, caught in his duplicity and half-convinced of the truth of DuQuesne's statements, still temporized. ""You're modest, aren't you, Doctor?"" he asked, smiling. [SNIPPET] They could not reproduce themselves, and as a natural result crime died out."" ""That is,"" he added hastily, ""what we regard as crime. Duelling, for instance, is a crime upon Earth; here it is a regular custom. In Kondal duels are rather rare and are held only when honor is involved, but here in Mardonale they are an every-day affair, as you saw when you landed."" ""What makes the difference?"""
2482,"""Maybe the worst of all,"" Les was saying, ""is the sense of being carried along, swiftly and helplessly, by things that are too big and complicated. You wish you could find a ledge somewhere in the time-stream and stop for a while to get your bearings. Sometimes you feel that you are in a one-way tunnel where you have to keep moving. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Maybe it's just a matter of personal adjustment—a taking of whatever comes."" [SNIPPET] We've got to meet a bigger future or be destroyed, Eddie. Everything takes nerve."" At last the earthquake shocks lessened both in intensity and frequency. Maybe the worst was over."
2483,"We can get it later."" ""Good, I'd really like to take those pictures,"" Tom said. "" Incidentally, who did the carvings?"" ""We did,"" Jock said. "" Together."" Tom was grateful that the scamper of the children out of the room saved him from having to reply. [SNIPPET] Of course, you might feel differently. What's your group, did you say?"" ""Tosker-Brown,"" Tom told him, adding when the beard frowned, ""the Fellowship people, you know."" ""I don't,"" the beard confessed. "" Where are you located?"" Tom briefly described the ranch house and cabins at the other end of the valley. ""Comic, I can't place it."""
2484,"""Welcome to out cozy nest, Mister,"" a voice from the depths of a big chair called, and the officer ran forward to where he could see. "" You certainly made time, and am I happy to see you soldiers. Get me out of these things,"" and Hanlon rattled his chains. At the admiral's gesture the marines made short work of the manacles, and Hanlon stood up, tottered a moment and would have fallen but for the quickly extended friendly arm of the admiral. He was still groggy, even though the serum was wearing off. But he was almost in complete control of his mind. [SNIPPET] If only I could really read minds! I think this guy knows something I want to learn, but I can't get the least idea of what it is."" But he kept trying, and not only with the mind of this one man he had been sent here to guard. He reached out to all other minds in the room, but none of them seemed to have any thoughts about the why of this unexpected happenstance."
2485,"Never sleep on a strange planet, he told himself futilely. The Merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of terror. The Explorer called, ""It's only a native of this planet. It won't harm you."" But even as he spoke, the giant had swooped down and in a moment they were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness. The Merchant struggled violently and, of course, quite futilely. "" Can't you talk to it?"" [SNIPPET] ""And the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing of all that?"" ""Not just the new knowledge. Rather the whole effect of change, of a broadening of horizons. Look, sir, I chose you to approach in this matter not only because you were rich and influential with government officials, but because you had an unusual reputation, for these days, of daring to break with tradition."
2486,"You gentry are always ready to do a man such a turn. Pray, Sir, did you ever do a good job for anyone to counterbalance that? For, if you have not, you ought to be—""  ""Hold, Sir, I say! None of your profanity before me. If I do evil to anyone on such occasions, it is because he will have it so; therefore, the evil is not of my doing. I ask you, Sir, before God and this witness, I ask you, have you kept solemnly and inviolate the vows which I laid upon you that day? [SNIPPET] One at a time, you cowards!' etc., to all which the unnatural fiend in the tartans answered with a loud exulting laugh; and then, taking the poor paralysed murderer by the bow of the arm, he hurried him in the dark entry once more, where I lost sight of them for ever.""  Before this time Mrs. Logan had risen up; and, when the narrator had finished, she was standing with her arms stretched upwards at their full length, and her visage turned down, on which were portrayed the lines of the most absolute horror. "" The dark suspicions of my late benefactor have been just, and his last prediction is fulfilled,"" cried she. """
2487,"""Didn't you find that your springs couldn't stand up under the acceleration?"" ""Yes, they flattened out dead."" ""The Kolanix Felan, in charge of the work, thought so, and substituted our compound-compensated type, made of real spring metal, for them. They'll hold you through any acceleration you can live through."" ""Thanks, that's fine. [SNIPPET] You are widely known as an able man. In fact, you have helped this company several times in various deal—er, in various ways."" ""Say it. Brookings. ' Deals' is the right word. This one is going to be the biggest ever."
2488,"That one, the Hupmobile, is the last—"" ""Who bought the others?"" the big man interrupted. ""No one,"" quavered Solomon, terror gripping his throat with a nervous hand. [SNIPPET] The cap was laid on the carburetor flange and stuck in place with painter's masking tape. He then bolted the exhaust manifold over the intake so the muffler connection barely touched the hub cap. Solomon stood up, kicked the manifolds with his heavy boots to make sure they were solid and grunted with satisfaction of a job well done. He moved his tray of tools away and trailed the hub cap twine behind the solid body of a big old Ford station wagon. He'd read of scientists in block houses when they shot rockets and was taking no chances. Excitement glistened Solomon's old eyes as what blood pressure there was rose a point or two with happy thoughts."
2489,"The plants formed rows on both sides of the road and from each plant rose a dozen or more of the big broad leaves, which swayed continually from side to side, although no wind was blowing. But the most curious thing about the swaying leaves was their color. They seemed to have a general groundwork of blue, but here and there other colors glinted at times through the blue—gorgeous yellows, turning to pink, purple, orange and scarlet, mingled with more sober browns and grays—each appearing as a blotch or stripe anywhere on a leaf and then disappearing, to be replaced by some other color of a different shape. The changeful coloring of the great leaves was very beautiful, but it was bewildering, as well, and the novelty of the scene drew our travelers close to the line of plants, where they stood watching them with rapt interest.  Suddenly a leaf bent lower than usual and touched the Patchwork Girl. Swiftly it enveloped her in its embrace, covering her completely in its thick folds, and then it swayed back upon its stem. [SNIPPET] ""Turns everything it touches to solid marble. It's an invention of my own, and I find it very useful. Once two of those dreadful Kalidahs, with bodies like bears and heads like tigers, came here from the forest to attack us; but I sprinkled some of that Liquid on them and instantly they turned to marble. I now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden. This table looks to you like wood, and once it really was wood; but I sprinkled a few drops of the Liquid of Petrifaction on it and now it is marble."
2490,"Best to proceed, the Coroner thought. "" I was not aware that we have Martians to contend with."" ""If I'd had the right weapon to use on Smith, you wouldn't be aware of it now. We still exercise caution."" The Coroner felt a certain pity. "" Why did you kill Smith?"" ""We Martians have found science-fiction writers to be our greatest danger. [SNIPPET] They returned the Coroner's look, apparently ready to move on his order. The thin, mirthless smile was still on Cole's lips. Maniacal violence could lie just behind it. Possibly Cole was armed. Better to play for time—try to quiet the madness within."
2491,"Jim looked at him in amazement. “ To-night?” “Yes. Or rather, the experiment will be at dawn. If successful, this continent at least will be rid of the menace.” Jim’s amazement turned to incredulity and a sudden fear gripped him. [SNIPPET] It was littered with strange devices now, strangest of all perhaps a huge glass tube like a cannon, mounted on some sort of swivel base. Ignoring this for the moment, he turned to a smaller tube set upright on a table at the far end of the room. In it, glowed a sinister orange lump that made the whole tube fluorescent. “Behold one of your monsters in captivity!”"
2492,"The army was succeeding in establishing itself on American soil. But around noon a ""stop"" signal flashed on the control boards of the tanks. They halted at the crest of a little rise and climbed out to look around. ""What is it?"" [SNIPPET] ""I know,"" said Gloria Rutherford, falling into the spirit of his suggestion. "" The old Metropolitan Opera. That eyesore has worried me for the last five years."" The suggestion was endorsed with enthusiasm. They climbed into the taxi and twenty minutes later were hilariously kindling a blaze in the back-stage section of the old building, running out of it with childish delight to watch the pillar of smoke grow and spread as the flames caught the timbers, long dry with age."
2493,"But all this belonged—I mean their magnificent little surrender—just to the special array of the facts that were most abysmal. Turned out for Sunday by his uncle’s tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, Miles’s whole title to independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing to say. I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet him when the revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution because I now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was precipitated. “ Look here, my dear, you know,” he charmingly said, “when in the world, please, am I going back to school?”  Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly as uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off intonations as if he were tossing roses. There was something in them that always made one “catch,” and I caught, at any rate, now so effectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the road. [SNIPPET] I had to smother a kind of howl. “ And you could bear it!”  “No. I couldn’t—and I can’t now!” And the poor woman burst into tears.  A rigid control, from the next day, was, as I have said, to follow them; yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back together to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that Sunday night, I was, in the immediate later hours in especial—for it may be imagined whether I slept—still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me."
2494,"But—you seem to have entirely missed the point of what I was saying.”  “No, I haven’t,” said Zuleika.  “Then what,” cried the Duke, standing over her, “what is your reply?”  Said Zuleika, looking up at him, “My reply is that I think you are an awful snob.”  The Duke turned on his heel, and strode to the other end of the room. [SNIPPET] You must forgive me for saying that the noise you have just made around this table was very like to the noise made on the verge of the Boer War. And your procedure seems to me as unaccountable as would have seemed the antics of those mobs if England had been plainly doomed to disaster and to vassalage. My guest here to-night, in the course of his very eloquent and racy speech, spoke of the need that he and you should preserve your ‘free and independent manhood.’ That seemed to me an irreproachable ideal. But I confess I was somewhat taken aback by my friend’s scheme for realising it. He declared his intention of lying prone and letting Miss Dobson ‘walk over’ him; and he advised you to follow his example; and to this counsel you gave evident approval."
2495,"The tractors were parked in this shadow, and beside and between them were piles of equipment and specimens. The apparatus Schlossberg had devised was beside the tractor at the north end of the line, just inside the shaded area. It was still just inside the shade when they finished, four hours later. Hargedon had joined them during the final hour and helped pack the equipment in the tractor he was to drive. Zaino had had no trouble in learning to make the observations Schlossberg wanted, and the youngster was almost unbearably cocky. Schlossberg hoped, as they returned to the Albireo, that no one would murder the communications expert in the next twelve hours. [SNIPPET] However, the two were able to tell for themselves before getting back to the Albireo. The flow didn't stop all at once, of course; but with the valley feeding it blocked off by a pile of volcanic ash four hundred feet high on one side, nearly fifty on the other and more than a quarter of a mile long, its enthusiasm quickly subsided. It was thin, fluid stuff, as Burkett had noted; but as it spread it cooled, and as it cooled it thickened. Six hours after the blast it had stopped with its nearest lobe almost a mile from the ship, less than two feet thick at the edge."
2496,"""May I come in?"" boomed a voice from the veranda.  The shadow of a squat figure had stolen across the patch of sunlight. That voice! [SNIPPET] You've spoiled everything, Ned,"" she said. "" It's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing comes in! It is such a pity! Why can't you control yourself?""  ""I didn't invent it,"" I pleaded. "" It's nature."
2497,"“Certainly. That’s what is so frustrating. We try to X ray the thing, and we don’t get a thing. We bombarded it with every radiation we could think of, from radio to gamma and it just reflected them. [SNIPPET] This plane of ‘semi-treated’ atoms can be forced through an object, if it is moved horizontally, but its ‘untreated’ aspect prevents the subject wearing the device from falling through the floor. “Busch demonstrated this device to me, turning it on and strolling through various objects in this room. Think of it! No soldier could be killed or held prisoner. And—” “Now hang on,” objected Max. “ Let’s not run away with ourselves."
2498,"""Why not call things by their right names and save breath, as long as we're alone? I'm not squeamish. But to get down to business. You know Seaton, of our division, of course. [SNIPPET] asked Brookings. Perkins slid down into his chair in deep thought, his pale eyes under half-closed lids darting here and there, his stubby fingers worrying his watch-chain restlessly. ""Who is the girl?"" he asked at last. ""Dorothy Vaneman, the daughter of the lawyer."
2499,"Now, sir,” says he, “these men may, when they please, or when occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their children, leave them to perish, and take other women, and marry them while these are living;” and here he added, with some warmth, “How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty? And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, however good in themselves, and however sincere in your design, while these men, who at present are your subjects, under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery?” I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more with the convincing arguments he supported it with; but I thought to have got off my young priest by telling him that all that part was done when I was not there: and that they had lived so many years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy; nothing could be done in it now. “Sir,” says he, “asking your pardon for such freedom, you are right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could not be charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you are not, therefore, under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an end to it. You should legally and effectually marry them; and as, sir, my way of marrying may not be easy to reconcile them to, though it will be effectual, even by your own laws, so your way may be as well before God, and as valid among men. I mean by a written contract signed by both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid.” [SNIPPET] But, sir,” says he, “I hope you will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged for our own preservation to disarm them, and make them our subjects, as they would not be content with being moderately our masters, but would be our murderers.” I answered I was afraid of it when I left them there, and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that they were not come back, that I might have put them in possession of everything first, and left the others in a state of subjection, as they deserved; but if they had reduced them to it I was very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault with it; for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief. While I was saying this, the man came whom he had sent back, and with him eleven more. In the dress they were in it was impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he made all clear, both to them and to me."
